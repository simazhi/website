Mandarin Chinese meteorological expressions and their iconicity\"](https://brill.com/view/journals/cose/4/2/article-p230_230.xml) (Van Hoey 2018, doi: 10.1163/23526416-00402003) (***Contact me if you want to read a copy but you don't have access***), I talk about the two kinds of motivation that we can observe in weather-related ideophones.\n\n**A first kind**, let's call them *colloquial ideophones*, are formally marked in their phonology, mostly through different types of reduplication (full and partial).\nThe way iconicity or sound symbolism works in these words is that when you try to map aspects of the sound on the meaning of the expressions and notice a resemblance.\nFor instance, the back vowels and nasals /oŋ/ in *hōnglónglóng* perhaps evoke the rumbling (notice the back vowel and nasal in *r**um**bling*) of thunder.\nOr in ablaut ideophones like *xīlī huālā* or *dīdī dādā* you get that alternating \"over here (high vowel /i,i/) ... over there (low vowel /a,a/)\" effect.\nCombined with the fricatives of /x/ and /h/, it's easy to imagine a kind of sluicing rainfall in *xīlī huālā*. \nAnd then l- reduplication is well-known in Chinese as a marker of continuation.\nCompare this to the unaspirated alveolar /d/'s of *dīdī dādā* that indicate [drips and drops](https://youtu.be/SOKGZb38e5c). \n\nJust so we're clear, I'm not saying these words are compositional in the way Hamano has argued for Japanese, but conversely that I can see how structural mappings can be identified or imagined. \n\n\n- *hōnglónglóng* (轟)隆 隆 'sound of thunder'\n- *xīlī huālā* 唏 哩 嘩 啦 'streaming and sluicing, heavy rainfall'\n- *dīdī dādā* 滴 滴 答 答 'lighter rainfall, just beginning or about to end'\n\n**The second kind**, *literary ideophones* by lack of a better term also typically display formal phonological markedness (full or partial reduplication) and also sometimes some phonesthemic-like elements. However, what sets them apart is that they can rely more on **radical support**. \nRadical support is the idea that the graphical form of a (Chinese) word contains a semantic element that is expressed, often repeated, that indicates something about the meaning of that word. \nMost people know that onomatopoeia (sound ideophones) in Mandarin often have a 口 MOUTH element, e.g., *jījī zhāzhā* 嘰嘰喳喳 'sound of birds chirping; sound of people chattering'. \nBut literary ideophones typically have other radicals. \nIn the examples below WATER 氵 and RAIN ⻗.\nThey are also typically older and not as in use in spoken language as the colloquial ones; but of course, they often turn up in song lyrics, sung in karaoke bars. \nSo I wouldn't flat out say they don't belong to the contemporary Chinese, just that there is a genre effect.\n\n- *línlín* 淋淋 'streaming and sluicing; dash and splatter'\n- *línlí* 淋漓 'light drizzle'\n- *màimù* 霢霂 'soaked and steeped'\n- *fēifēi* 霏霏 'heavy snowfall or rainfall'\n- *pīlì* 霹靂 'thunderclap, thunderbolt'\n\n\n# *Hōnglónglóng* is the sound of thunder\n\nAnyways, I can go on and on about these words but it's now time to turn back to Fang Shangyang and his 轰隆隆 *is the sound of thunder*. \nI will present the poem below, which, in the spirit of fair use and commentary on (please Shangyang Fang or publishing house, I do this out of love and don't come back to sue me, I hope you sell many copies), I have augmented with pinyin in red so as to show how to pronounce these words and so that you can enjoy the poem to its fullest.\n\nAlso, pay attention to what kind of ideophones are used here. \nThey virtually all belong to the colloquial stratum, which tells you that indeed, we should be reading the poem out loud to make most sense of it.\n\nFinally, I hope the lay-out matches that of the original poem but I can't be sure. \nJust know that it's supposed to have a few lines per paragraph usually.\n\nOkay, enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**轰隆隆 <span style='color: red;'>hōnglōnglōng</span> Is the Sound of Thunder  **\n  \nBy Shāngyáng Fāng 方商羊  \n  \n\nis the rain stitching a bell jar, or the clock remembering its days  \nas a clepsydra.扑通 <span style='color: red;'>pūtōng</span> is the sound of: man stumbling  \n＆ 哈哈哈哈 <span style='color: red;'>hāhāhāhā</span> is the laughter that chases after  \n玲玲琅琅 <span style='color: red;'>línglíng lángláng</span> is the water sword whacking the 哐当锵锵 <span style='color: red;'>kuāngdāng qiāng qiāng</span> jade pendants  \nof cold rocks. 飒飒瑟瑟 <span style='color: red;'>sàsà sèsè</span> is the west wind & 扑扑簌簌 <span style='color: red;'>pūpū sùsù</span>  \nis the falling leaves that 萧萧翩翩 <span style='color: red;'>xiāoxiāo piānpiān</span> with an autumnmoon  \n  \nIn fact, 簌簌 <span style='color: red;'>sùsù</span> is the sound of all soft things falling  \nThe tears 簌簌 <span style='color: red;'>sùsù</span> on the face.
