# Project description

One important aspect of my PhD research consisted of collecting Chinese ideophones (or candidates of that category) in a central place.
The Chinese Ideophone Database (**CHIDEOD**) provided the perfect place for this.

The make-up of the database is explained in this article:

## Interactive app

I made [an interactive app](https://simazhi.shinyapps.io/chideod_appversion/) in the Shiny framework for easy consultation of the database.

This app also can export into multiple formats, e.g., .csv, .xlsx.

## R package

If you want to use it directly in R, you can [follow the instructions on the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/simazhi/chinese_ideophone_database).

## OSF page

The data can also also be found [on this OSF repository](https://osf.io/kpwgf/).
