Ruiming’s PhD project aims to answer the question: Does grammatical optionality (e.g., the witch’s wand vs. the wand of the witch) complicate speech production and comprehension? Using a Mandarin Chinese corpus, she attempts to identify the impact of grammatical optionality on dysfluencies in speech production; on the other hand, she will carry out a psycholinguistic experiment to measure the correlation between grammatical optionality and speech comprehension.
