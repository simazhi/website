<p>What do you mean “too long, didn’t read”?</p>
<p>Go read it, it’s not that long, not even in times of diminished/diminishing concentration due to cellphone addiction.</p>
<p>But okay okay, two papers of mine appeared on the same day in their online and #OpenAccess version. This deserves to be celebrated. Ecce this blogpost.</p>

<h1>Am I entering my acceptance era?</h1>
<p><em>January 31.</em> I wake up and, regretabbly out of a bad habit, scroll through all the apps I still allow notifications from. Among them, Outlook (you never know when the world happens to burn down during the night – an ever more likely scenario). Yet, this time it’s a great message:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hi Thomas Congratulations on your high-quality paper submitted to COSE [Cognitive Semantics, <em>tvh</em>].<br>
It will be the first OA paper accepted and published online in 2025. COSE will be turned to OA from 2025 onwards, sponsored by my universiy,Beihang, which means we have paid the OA fee for your article.</p>
<p>Best Thomas Li Editor-in-Chief</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very excited because I kind of did that paper “between the soup and the potatoes” as we say in Dutch. It is linked to a special issue devoted to new applications of the Talmyan motion typology (Talmy 2000a, b) to the realm of ideophones. The editors for this special issue, Kiyoko Toratani and Kimi Akita, already had held a great online workshop about this topic a few months before, last summer. Alas, I couldn’t join then but I watched the recordings, and figured I could do something with (literary) Chinese ideophones. So I am very grateful to them for still inviting me and keeping me in the loop for this special issue.</p>
<p>Last February or so I did a bout of annotating and invoked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awen">awen</a> for creative writing. Add to that a few walks in the woods of Wuustwezel (#uilenbos) and whippity whoopi, the idea for a paper emerged. I made some vague promises in the abstract about what I predicted my findings to be. Okay, it must be said, after working on Chinese ideophones for almost a decade now, I have developed some intuitions of what the data is like, so it’s not like that came totally out of thin air.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months, and I’m annotating the data between the FWO interview and the result to keep myself busy. I try a few clustering techniques. And lo and behold, one of my most favorite papers suddenly takes shape.</p>
<p><strong>I am actually very proud of this one.</strong> It’s probably the most QLVL’y paper I’ve made to date. And the graphics came out pretty well.</p>
<p>For example, this 3D version of plotting first- and second-level components (it’s a bit technical, <em>sowwy</em>) was really cool to make.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2025-04-29-double-whammy/mca.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I also know I had a good paper in my hands when I presented it at the 21st International Congress of Linguists (September 2024 in Poznań, Poland) and the feedback of the audience was really positive.</p>
<p>So yeah, am I entering my paper acceptance era??</p>
</section>
<section id="slow-science" class="level1">
<h1>Slow science</h1>
<p>It certainly seems like this finally the paper acceptance era. For example, one key piece of research conducted during my postdoc at the University of Hong Kong also finally came through in the last few months. Note that this was not an easy birth: it took us quite a few years to cast our conference presentation into a coherent paper that the reviewers/gatekeepers (you know who you are Reviewer 2!) deemed acceptable. On top of that, the journal we submitted it to in the end, Cognitive Linguistics, had a switch of editor in chief, and that also delayed it, as far as I understand the history.</p>
<p>The concept of the paper is quite simple: we played the game of telephone. But with a twist: we would be looking at ideophones and gesture interplay + teaching some participants the wrong, non-iconic mappings.</p>
<p>This transmission experiment led to lots of interesting findings. But the ones that made it into the paper revolved around the gesture parameter of handshape, an aspect of sign languages and gesture in general that is generally viewed as not the most salient, yet important for conveying nuance. We found that we can break iconic mappings down into smaller features, like a phonological system. Sometimes iconicity “breaks” when the physiological naturalness of certain handshapes evolves into different configurations. Other times, iconicity acts as a strong enough force to resist those natural tendencies of handshape drift.</p>
<p>Cool stuff! Enjoy this picture.</p>

<section id="new-site" class="level1">
<h1>New site</h1>
<p>Hello beautiful readers.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I updated this blog. But I figured that now’s as good a time as any to do so. After all, I just transferred the back-end of my website from <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> to <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/">quarto websites</a>. How do you like the new look? For me it looks fresher and maybe more mature, if that’s an adjective you can use to describe a website.</p>
<p>More excitingly, today is also the day my new postdoctoral project begins. And while I could try to keep up with the previous updates that happened in my academic life, I think I’ll just see this as a new beginning. But that doesn’t mean I won’t be giving updates on exciting papers that are in the pipeline. Rather, <em>if I’m being really honest here</em>, the venn diagram with the readership of my blog and people that I engage with on a (semi-)regular basis is basically a circle.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/53455466698/in/album-72177720321614991" title="The Two Towers (FWO and KU Leuven)"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53455466698_95f80f2066_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="The Two Towers (FWO and KU Leuven)"></a>

</section>
<section id="who-dis" class="level1">
<h1>Who dis</h1>
<p>So in a twist of logic, I probably don’t need to do an update, because most will have seen the wonderful places I’ve been able to go to in my time working on the <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/projects/grammatical_alternation_complexity/">complexity project</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bszmrecsanyi/">Benedikt Szmrecsanyi</a>. For example, with the gracious support from Benedikt, I was able to travel <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2023-03-05-leaving-the-liminal/">to Oxford</a> for the project start-up with Matt H. Gardner, to South Africa, Australia, Germany, Greece, Leuven (🫰), and soon the center of the world, aka Antwerp (🫰).</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/53453385006/in/album-72177720321614991" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53453385006_27b1e4feb5_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Formally, the time has come and gone that I was hired on that project. Of course, I am still involved and will remain to be so as long as I’m here. I feel I have finally gotten a grip on the issues within the variationist literature that we are talking about, and working with the SWITCHBOARD spoken corpus data definitely has helped with that. Besides, working with Benedikt is truly a pleasure. That is why we also have a shared PhD student, Ruiming Ma, who is looking at similar things as I was but in Chinese data, which is really exciting. <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/supervision/ma_ruiming">You can read more about that project here</a>.</p>
<p>Last February, I was also happy to receive my previous supervisor from HKU, Youngah Do, here in Leuven. It was a great opportunity to wrap up some projects we still had in the pipeline, but you know, after some reviewer time had passed. Academic schedules and scholarly time move at a different pace than most people realize.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/53765051862/in/album-72177720321614991/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53765051862_0ab51e6172_c.jpg" width="640" height="800" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>In general, I have landed in a remarkably good research environment. Without exaggeration, it is hard to find days in which just a quick conversation with someone from the linguistics department says something that makes you go: <em>oh, huh, interesting, lemme think about it</em>, in particular the people from the <a href="https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl">QLVL</a>. <a href="https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/func">FunC</a> research groups, Sometimes this concerns particular methods, or ways of looking at the data; other times, it’s just a topic or a turn in the conversation that will linger on. And bonus points for them for putting up with my stupid jokes at lunch time. It is appreciated.</p>
<p>As a group, we work well. I wouldn’t say it’s a hive mind culture, but more a concerned individuals focus group that discusses all sorts of issues. And we’ve also done some team building. For instance, here is the group pic of our QLVL teambuilding last summer.</p>

<h1>New project</h1>
<p>Now, one of the reasons why it has been a minute since I updated my blog is that *I’ve been busy.* Even though I got all the support I needed, after about half a year I realized that I couldn’t just rest on my laurels and diminish, go into the West and remain Galadriel. No, if I wanted all to love me and despair, to make this Galadriel metaphor even more convoluted, I would need to start applying to grants, professorships or postdoc fellowships.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/53453701014/in/album-72177720321614991" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53453701014_4ceac5040e_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>While I originally had the idea to apply for an ERC Starting Grant, I was too late last year and my idea wasn’t full-fledged yet either. But luckily I was able to channel it into an application for the <a href="https://www.fwo.be/en/support-programmes/all-calls/postdoctoral-researchers/senior-postdoctoral-fellowship/">Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship of the Research Foundation of Flanders</a>, our national funding agency. Fortunately, I didn’t have to sell my soul to Lucifer, so I was able to put off a Faustian deal, but just to be sure I went to this statue in Liège on the day of the interview after the event. <em>#hustleculture</em></p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/53916366484/in/album-72177720321614991" title="Me on the day of the oral interview making a deal with Lucifer"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53916366484_7a58c39d39_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Me on the day of the oral interview making a deal with Lucifer"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I’m grateful that <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bszmrecsanyi/">Benedikt</a> agreed to act as the supervisor the project. And I’ve also gotten my previous MA in Linguistics’ supervisor <a href="https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/english/our-staff/zap/jeanchristopheverstraete">Jean-Christophe Verstraete</a> on board. They are both a great match because the former specialized in variationist linguistics, and the latter in typology. And my project is situated at the crossroads between these two.</p>
<p>The full title of the project is <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/projects/borrowing_iconic_words/">“Borrowing iconic words: Loss, transfer, and reinvention of depiction”</a>. To give you an idea of the written pitch, here are the first paragraph of my project.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The past two decades have shown that iconicity is a fundamental aspect of language. Words are iconic when their forms reveal something about their meanings. For example, <em>woof</em> sounds like the ‘sound of a dog barking’, and <em>zigzag</em> reveals something about ‘running while alternating from side to side’. Iconic words can be found in any natural language. Non-iconic words (prosaic words) can also display iconicity, such as size sound symbolism (/a/ is big, /i/ is small). <strong>This is especially true for core vocabulary, i.e., words that resist borrowing into other language families. Hence, there is the hypothesis that iconicity is negatively correlated with borrowability. Surprisingly, this hypothesis has not been tested on iconic words, making it hard to estimate the limits of the relationship between iconicity and borrowing.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you can see that there is the impetus: there is this idea that is floating around. Clearly, I don’t entirely agree with it, for reasons my future papers will make clear. In any case, my proposed solution to this problem is to study the relationship between borrowability and iconicity starting from iconic words rather than from prosaic words that were (synchronically) rated in iconicity.</p>
<p>I’m very excited to start on this project. The first task consists of the creation of a typological database with lots of iconic lexical material, think onomatopoeia (<em>meow</em>, <em>woof</em>, <em>bang!</em>) and ideophones (<em>zigzag</em>, Jap. <em>pikapika</em> ‘flashing’). The want for such a database is not entirely new. Back in the covid times of 2020-2021, a few of us (Bonnie McLean, Ian Joo, Arthur Thompson, Mark Dingemanse, Jiyeon Park) had the idea to create some sort of “<em>IdeoNet</em>”. But we didn’t really have the funding or the space in our careers to do so. Having advanced a bit further in the career trajectory, I am happy we do have the funding and dedicated man-hour task (i.e., me and my project) to work on this. It is also rebranded as “<em>Depicticon</em>”. So <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/projects/borrowing_iconic_words/">keep an eye out</a> and if you have data to share, please do so.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/53455760975/in/album-72177720321614991/" title=" "><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53455760975_165eaaf68b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt=" "></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The rest of the project remains for a future update, shrouded in the mist that has been descending on an autumnal seasoned Leuven. Time to go watch some colored leaves fall down. Adieu.</p>

  <title>Iconicity in ideophones: Guessing, memorizing, and reassessing</title>
  <dc:creator>Thomas Van Hoey</dc:creator>
  <link>https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2023-04-21-reassessing/</link>

<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2023-04-21-reassessing/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Hooray, our paper came out, openly accessible in <em>Cognitive Science</em>! Its title is “Iconicity in ideophones: Guessing, memorizing, and reassessing” and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.13268">you can find it here</a>.</p>
<p>Grateful to have been able to work with my co-authors: Arthur Lewis Thompson, Youngah Do and Mark Dingemanse.</p>
<section id="abstract" class="level1">
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>(skip this if it’s too technical)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Iconicity, or the resemblance between form and meaning, is often ascribed to a special status and contrasted with default assumptions of arbitrariness in spoken language. But does iconicity in spoken language have a special status when it comes to learnability? A simple way to gauge learnability is to see how well something is retrieved from memory. We can further contrast this with guessability, to see (1) whether the ease of guessing the meanings of ideophones outperforms the rate at which they are remembered; and (2) how willing participants’ are to reassess what they were taught in a prior task—a novel contribution of this study. We replicate prior guessing and memory tasks using ideophones and adjectives from Japanese, Korean, and Igbo. Our results show that although native Cantonese speakers guessed ideophone meanings above chance level, they memorized both ideophones and adjectives with comparable accuracy. However, response time data show that participants took significantly longer to respond correctly to adjective–meaning pairs—indicating a discrepancy in a cognitive effort that favored the recognition of ideophones. In a follow-up reassessment task, participants who were taught foil translations were more likely to choose the true translations for ideophones rather than adjectives. By comparing the findings from our guessing and memory tasks, we conclude that iconicity is more accessible if a task requires participants to actively seek out sound-meaning associations.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>As regular readers of this blog will know, ideophones are iconic words. That means that their meanings are somehow apparent in the sounds of those words. Or, there is a perceived resemblance between form and meaning.</p>
<p>We have known for a while now that people all over the world are sensitive so certain form-meaning mappings, especially in laboratory phonology studies, which use stimuli like <em>kiki</em> and <em>bouba</em> (go ask your grandma which one she thinks is ‘round and curvy’ and which one is ‘sharp and spiky’ — I bet she’ll make the correct choice [but also don’t come at me for your earnings]).</p>
<p>We have also known that infants and children pick up these words really early. Think of the time you had to learn the sounds of all animals. That’s easy and evocative because those onomatopoeic sounds have a strong resemblance in form and meaning.</p>
<p>Researchers have proposed that it’s exactly that form-meaning mapping that makes it easier to remember those onomatopoeic sounds. And so they’re easier to learn, because you need to less of an effort to make arbitrary connections, like you have to do for most words, e.g., the word <em>wall</em> doesn’t indicate anything about its meaning of WALL.</p>
<p>And if those words are easier to learn, they should also be easier to memorize right?</p>
</section>
<section id="guessing" class="level1">
<h1>Guessing</h1>
<p>But actually, learning is such a big and vague task, that it’s useful to separate how “guessable” these words are by virtue of their form. For instance, you can probably guess that <em>miāo</em> is a sound made by a cat (in Chinese), but can you guess what the word <em>nuru-nuru</em> in Japanese means? If I tell you that it means ‘slippery’ you might make an easy connection there between those /n/ and /r/ sounds, but one that may not be obvious just by looking at it. So that means that <em>miāo</em> is more guessable than <em>nuru-nuru</em>.</p>
<p>Okay, quick side note, another recent paper by McLean et al.&nbsp;(2023) talks about these issues as well, <a href="https://www.bonniemclean.net/news/2023-04-18-iconicitymeasurespaper/">so go check that out</a> when you’re done here.</p>
<p>There are quite a few studies that look the guessability of words, often using English speakers. In our study, we wanted to see if Cantonese speakers were good at guessing the meaning of ideophones. And we used ideophones from three languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_language">Igbo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language">Korean</a>).</p>
<p>This experiment, which replicated the methods of a <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/621185">study by Dingemanse et al.&nbsp;2016</a> found that our Cantonese participants are very good at guessing the correct meaning when presented with two choice alternatives. As expected, especially for ideophones depicting sound meanings.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2023-04-21-reassessing/images/exp1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="memorizing" class="level1">
<h1>Memorizing</h1>
<p>Okay, so we were interested in learning. After making sure that our participants were sensititive to these words, we were wondering how good they would be at remembering them.</p>
<p>So we conducted another experiment, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxlm0000235">inspired by Lockwood et al.&nbsp;(2016)</a>.</p>
<p>We made it quite tricky. Half of the form-meaning mappings that participants learned were correct (<em>nuru-nuru</em> meaning ‘slippery’) and half of them were wrong (<em>nuru-nuru</em> means ‘flashing light’). After being exposed to those words we asked them whether they had learned a particular mapping.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like the game of Memory: you get presented with a form and a meaning and you need to tell whether they fit together or not, based on what you learned. It turns out that, on average, it’s hit or miss. There is no particular memory benefit in the ideophones we tested with Cantonese speakers that leads to a good memorisation.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2023-04-21-reassessing/images/exp2_memory.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Also, importantly, we also conducted this experimental protocol with adjectives and the results were very similar. It’s all in the paper, but I’m just highlighting the ideophone part here.</p>

<p>Remember how participants sometimes had to learn the correct meaning for an ideophone and other times a wrong, coerced meaning? That comes back now.</p>
<p>After the memorization task, we basically told them: hey, we have taught you the wrong meaning for half of the words you had to learn. Now it’s your turn to think again about these words. And then we exposed them to another guessing task. But because it’s after teaching and after memorizing, it’s in fact a reassessment task.</p>
<p>The participants were pretty good at this task (details in paper).</p>
<p>What I’ll show here is whether participants decided to stick with the meaning they had learned or choose the alternative we presented to them. After all, if ideophones have iconic aspects to tap into, people should be reluctant to choose the alternative when given the choice to change what they had learned, and vice versa, should be eager to change when presented with the real meaning, abandoning the wrong meaning because it was not motivated in a form-meaning mapping.</p>
<p>I quickly mentioned that we also looked at adjectives. For those words, we didn’t have any special predictions, but it turns out they be have somewhat similar to ideophones, although the effect is much less strong when we ran models.</p>
<p>So here you can see (on the right side) how the yellow mean is low at the 20% mark. This means that for those items, which were taught in the right condition, participants stuck to the original meaning they had learned. For coerced meanings (right side, blue), we get a mean of 57% or so, indicating very easy choices for the alternatives.</p>
<p>Looking at adjectives the true form-meaning mapping was also low, but the coerced one much closer to the halfway mark.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2023-04-21-reassessing/images/japanese.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For the other languages we found similar results (in the paper), though maybe less pronounced. The models we ran indicate that there are significant effects of language (Japanese &gt; Korean &gt; Igbo) and of course of type (ideophone &gt; adjective), as well as some important interactions with the condition boosting or curbing the effects.</p>
<p>But you’ll have to read the whole paper for that!</p>

<section id="main-take-away" class="level1">
<h1>Main take away</h1>
<p>Ideophones are, once again, proven to be quite guessable. However, the guessability aspects do not necessarily correlate with memory benefits (veridical recall). This may be because not all tasks invite people to think of form-meaning mappings as driven by iconicity. In fact, once given the chance to rethink and reassess the meanings of certain words, participants may tap into iconicity and choose the correct meaning after all, even if they didn’t remember whether they had learned a particular form-meaning pair.</p>
<p>Not all tasks investigating iconicity are equally good at drawing out iconicity. And the learning benefit of iconic words should at least be split up into guessability and memorization, if not more.</p>

<p>Shamelessly plugging my new article in <em>Cognitive Linguistics</em>, entitled “ABB, a salient prototype of collocate–ideophone constructions in Mandarin Chinese.” <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cog-2022-0031/html">click me</a></p>

<section id="abb-not-abba" class="level1">
<h1>ABB, not ABBA</h1>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>The year is 2019. It’s September. You’re eating Chicago deep dish “pizza” in Taipei. Suddenly you hear people nearby play a fun game where they have to take turns saying a words of a certain form. If they’re too slow or say a wrong one, they’re out.</p>
<p>This actually happened to, and I couldn’t believe my ears. The words in question all had the syllabic template of ABB.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>lǜ-yóuyóu</em><br>
<em>yìng-bāngbāng</em><br>
<em>hēi-xūxū</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These, respectively, mean “very verdant green”, “super hard” and “deep black”. And as most speakers of Chinese languages will know, the BB part of them will add a certain vivid quality to the A part. The greenness of <em>lǜ</em> 綠 is elaborated in a vivid manner by the slipperiness of <em>yóuyóu</em>, which helps because <em>yóuyóu</em> 油油 means ‘oil oil’. On the other hand, the hardness of <em>yìng</em> 硬 ‘hard’ is elaborated by the hardness depicted by <em>bāngbāng</em> 邦邦. And the blackness of <em>hēi</em> 黑 by the BB part <em>xūxū</em> 魆魆.</p>
<p>These are one of the most fun parts of learning Chinese (honestly, all kinds of vivid words are fun to a certain degree, see <a href="https://ideophone.org/playful-iconicity-having-fun-with-words/">Dingemanse &amp; Thompson 2020</a>) and absolutely necessary to become a fluent speaker of Mandarin, but also Cantonese or other varieties, and they have special predictive properties as well (see <a href="https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ml.21016.tho">Thompson et al.&nbsp;2022</a>).</p>
</section>
<section id="abb-sound-symbolism-and-ideophones" class="level1">
<h1>ABB, sound symbolism and ideophones</h1>
<p>Already in the 1970s we find scholars like Benjamin K. T’sou (1978) stating that ABB forms are a particular locus for identifying sound symbolism in Chinese. Even if you don’t know what sound symbolism is, you may have hear about words like <em>kiki</em> and <em>bouba</em>. If I told you that one of these words sounds round and curvy, while the other is spiky and angular, there’s a very high chance that you would say <em>kiki</em> is the spiky angular one. There’s a whole field of linguistics that tries to identify patterns where the formal aspect of language (sound, but also writing) in some way reveal something about the meaning. That field is called iconicity.</p>
<p>Now, strictly speaking, not all statistical formal patterns that tell us something about the meaning are iconic, but that’s not the topic of this post. This post is also not about identifying particular mappings in ABB words.</p>
<p>What this post is about, is how ABB words - after that great observation by T’sou - were basically only studied from formal aspects and how they hang together with other permutations of patterns in which occur, think juggling letters like ABAB, ABB, BBA etc.</p>
<p>That led me to the belief (in my dissertation, <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/files/DISSERTATION.pdf">Van Hoey 2020</a>) that we should really be looking at these words from a more function point-of-view. If ABB words are so vivid, then that must mean there is at least the possibility that there is ideophony at play in them.</p>
<p>Ideophones can be cross-linguistically defined as “marked words that depict sensory imagery and which belong to an open lexical class” (<a href="https://benjamins.com/catalog/ill.16.02din">Dingemanse 2019</a>). But you probably know them as <em>onomatopoeias</em>. The only meaningful difference (for the majority of people in the field) is that onomatopoeia is seen as depiction of sound, while ideophones are much broader, covering senses like visual patterns, inner feelings, textures etc., which are not really in the scope of the term onomatopoeia.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-am-i-going-with-this" class="level1">
<h1>Where am I going with this</h1>
<p>Okay, so if ABB words potentially involve ideophone-like qualities, then most likely it will be in the BB part, as reduplication is a highly frequent trait of ideophones across languages. The A part, then, is somewhat of a fixed collocate of this ideophone. How do I know it’s fixed? Well, if you can play a game that’s not just random syllables of the form ABB, then there is a certain degree of idiomaticity at play as well.</p>
<p>So it stands to reason to think of ABB words as collocate-ideophone constructions.</p>
<p>But ABB words are not the only party in town (a reviewer in my article that I’m gonna plug in a second did not like that phrasing so I’m recycling it here). There are many other collocates we can look at, in varying length.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cog-2022-0031/html">my article</a> that recently came out in <em>Cognitive Linguistics</em> (currently ahead of print) I basically regale the story of ABB words, how they were studied traditionally, and what it would mean to treat them as collocate-ideophone constructions.</p>
<p>Of course, if they are collocate-ideophone constructions, they are probably “special” among those constructions, and I do find that they are prototypical in a sense. So finally I look at all the data from a number of perspectives, such as type frequency, token frequency, cue validity, dispersion. Finally, I put these single sources of information together in “tuples”.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you’ll check out the article.</p>

<p><em>Leaving the liminal</em>, a play on a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40334113-weave-the-liminal">book I recently read</a>, is an excellent title for this blog post, in which I will cover the final months in Hong Kong and the first months back in Belgium. As I hinted at <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/friends-along-the-way/">last time</a>, my return to Hong Kong in September (2022) was marked by the temporality of it all. And it wasn’t the first time I was in this temporary zone – it had happened in autumn 2020 as well, as I was preparing for going to Hong Kong. This particular temporary transitional phase resembles the state of being on a threshold: not quite outside anymore but not yet inside either. In other words, a liminal phase.</p>
<p>And I entered just such a phase in the month leading up to my departure from the big kong. So let’s begin from where we left off last time, and <em>enter the liminal</em>.</p>

<p>One of the most salient hallmarks of my imminent departure were all the gatherings with friends and colleagues. I have enjoyed all of them, whether it was pizza party, home dinner, walk around the block or gathering on or under a roof.</p>

<p>Also the idea of liminality was felt most clearly at the following exact time: 7 December 2022 at around 21 o’clock. At this particular time I met up with my friend Rita on the beach – itself not quite land and not quite sea, between the wild nature of Lamma Island and the steampunk inducing Power Station, under the full moon. I had already officially left HKU, but not quite yet Hong Kong. But at the same time the liminal is a time and space where some of the most transformational things can happen, like me reflecting on and reappreciating the times past and the times ahead. Oh and we made a bonfire, which is always super fun.</p>
<p>I cannot stress enough how thankful I am that I met these people. Even though I left, I feel good knowing that I’ve taken a piece of them with me, in return for offering up a piece of myself to them. Thanks for being guiding stars in my life.</p>

<p>Apart from the stress induced by dealing with all the administration (in a broad term, including taxes, rental contracts, clearing out my apartment, avoiding mr Toxic), I kept thinking of what I wanted to do these final week. Other people might want to go hiking or whatever, but I just mostly wanted to revisit places I had enjoyed before. And that includes museums. Here are some pictures.</p>

<h1>To Oxford</h1>
<p>Starting the new project in Leuven required that I pay a visit to Matt Gardner in Oxford. So I did, and in passing visited some scenic views of Oxford, as well as the musical Wicked. A trip to Oxford, in this day and age, also requires compatible reading. I chose <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57945316-babel-or-the-necessity-of-violence"><em>Babel, Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators’ Revolution</em> by RF Kuang</a>. It was a great book.</p>

<p>I can say that the feeling is much different from when I got to Hong Kong. If you recall (or <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-07-30-grounding-and-arting-in-hk/">if you want to reread</a>), I felt quite uprooted in Hong Kong. While I eventually grew some roots there, the feeling here has been much different. I can’t figure out if it’s the familiarity of coming back home, back to an alma mater, back to a number of friends (although meeting up with some of them turns out to be more arduous than it should be :s :s ), or feeling relieved about the absence of a certain coworker. In any case, I’m back, transformed after 7 years abroad and ready to face the future.</p>
<p>Leaving liminality, but, you know what, <em>I’m Leuven it.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2022-12-29-friends-along-the-way/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I’m writing this blog post from the comfort of my place back in Belgium, nice and cozy inside while the winter weather is whipping up its winds (no snow) outside. How did we get here? And what am I doing here? Let’s find out in today’s long-overdue update.</p>
<p>An instagram poll showed me that my audience there (n = 37) would be most interested in the journey that 2022 was and the friends we made along the way, hence the title of this update. I’d say it’s best we start this blog best somewhere mid February 2022, as the <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2022-02-28-1yearversary-in-hong-kong/">previous blog</a> dealt with the period before. I guess that puts us nicely in sync with the Chinese new year as the starting point for this blog. So, in order to make this extra Chinesey – not to be confused with <em>Chineasy</em>, a book with a catchy title that claims it is easy to learn Chinese but tricks the reader, I cannot stress this enough, do not buy – let’s try to consolidate updates in this blog based on key moments that happened in time frames dictated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_term">24 solar terms</a>.</p>
<section id="spring-commences-立春-4-feb" class="level1">
<h1>Spring commences 立春 4 Feb</h1>
<p>I guess I’ve always been into cyclical systems like calendars. For instance, learning about how the traditional Chinese calendar worked in my second year of college was super fascinating. Actually, I should be calling them calendar<strong>s</strong>, since it’s both a solar and a lunar calendar that at times needed to be put in sync again. Anyways, here is a picture of me looking at the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_the_Year">Wheel of the Year</a>, which contains a cycle of eight seasonal festivals. I like the concept very much, but I didn’t feel like it was particularly applicable to a Hong Kongtext, where it is cold for like 3 weeks in February and December.</p>

<p>While it wasn’t really cold, being covered by a blanket gives a sense of comfort and coziness that is second nature to Belgians. And apparently also to Polish and Siberian people, as evidenced by this picture of me, Rita and Dasha.</p>

<p>But, like, not every day. Sometimes it was still foggy. And on such a day I decided to surprise my friends Tomo and Jinyoung by awaiting them on the Peak.</p>

<p>Night and day are equally long and friends that had been held up (holed up?) abroad started making their way back to Hong Kong. Like Marcelo, who wanted to have a big bite at Big Bite.</p>

<h1>Bright and clear 清明 (aka my birthday) 5 Apr</h1>
<p>While my 30th birthday was an absolute disaster, at least initially, <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-07-30-grounding-and-arting-in-hk/">“due to circumstances”</a>, my 31st was exactly what I wanted. My friends that came over (shoutout to Tomo, Jinyoung, Marcelo and Yingheng) really managed to surprise me and the atmosphere of the evening was just right. Forever grateful.</p>

<p>Excitingly, I landed an interview for a faculty position at another university in Hong Kong. Disappointingly, the interviewers were late for the interview, which led me to panic, in an icecold manner, whether or not I was in the correct zoom room for about 4 minutes. Unmannerly, I did not receive any replies on whether I was still in the long/short list after inquiring after a month had passed. I mean, do I really want to work for a department that does not respect potential colleagues? Here is a picture of me with the mixed feelings after the interview. It went well, but they were late… <em>0/10 would not recommend.</em></p>

<p>Some of the friends made along the way are actually routes, if that makes sense. There is a sense of comfort in walking along pathways you know well and know better with every iteration. For me that would be the many walks I took along Victoria Harbour (HK side), from HKU to the pier. It didn’t hurt that the weather was amazing and the views appetizing.</p>

<p>And also some of the obligatory sightseeing. By the way, I started watching <em>Emily in Paris</em> while it was <em>Thomas in Paris</em> and it’s both cringey and fun. Also, I look like this self-portrait by Van Gogh, but I am Van Hoey.</p>

<p>In case it wasn’t clear, the weather was very good. 10/10.</p>
<p>In this period, I went to two very important places. The first is Leuven, where I finally went to visit my friends from the East Asian Library again (Arjan and Benedicte).</p>

<p>And I also met up with fellow <a href="https://www.marianamontes.me/">R aficionada and Cognitive linguist Mariana</a>. This turned out to be a very amusing afternoon, and also a very fruitful one, as it led me to my new job, which I will start very soon.</p>

<p>The second trip was visiting Nijmegen (Netherlands), where I spent the afternoon and them some with <a href="https://markdingemanse.net/">my other supervisor Mark</a>. Very enjoyable as well and beautiful campus.</p>

<h1>Moderate heat 小暑 7 Jul</h1>
<p>Even thought his solar term is called moderate heat I didn’t think it was very moderate; it was quite hot. And it only got hotter when my Spanish friend Antonio came to visit me. It had been a few years since we had seen each other but some friendships can definitely overcome this.</p>

<p>And then, one early morning – mind you I was still working during this time and often had meetings starting at 7 AM with a team that was working in HK time – I woke up and my mom told me she had phone problems. Grumbling and not yet quite awake I went to have a look and she showed me a screen of an airplane route, casually saying: “So, we need to pick CJ up this afternoon.” Thinking I was still dreaming, I splashed some water on my face and reconfirmed.</p>
<p>You see, a devious and cunning scheme had been going on behind my back, and nobody had told me that this was happening. So there I was, later that day, picking up my dearest baetje at the train station. It felt really good to see him again after 11 months.</p>

<p>So this summer back home turned out quite great I would say. We went to Brussels for a walk in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonian_Forest">Sonian Forest</a> and what I was selling to my friends as “the Stonehedge of Belgium” but is actually a <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_voor_de_Boswachters">monument to forestry</a> that’s only about a century old (sorry not sorry).</p>

<p>All good songs must come to an end. On CJ’s last day here we went to Leiden. One place we stopped at was the Tolkien store (nerd alert), where I was attacked by an Uruk-Hai.</p>

<h1>Frost 霜降 23 Oct</h1>
<p>In writing this blog, I have come to realize that the solar terms’ titles reflect my mood rather the Hong Kongnese environment. It started to dawn on me that time spent in the Fragrant Harbour was stretching thin. One thing I got to cross of the bucket list was Cantonese opera (I think it might have been Teochew opera but I’m not sure). Marcelo and Ksenia took me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hegemon-King_Bids_His_Lady_Farewell">Farewell my concubine</a>.</p>

<p>The next <em>natsukashii</em> thing is of course Halloween (samhain), one of the highlights of Lamma life. It started with an eerily purple hued sky, and lasted a good amount of time, which I spent watching people with friends.</p>

<h1>This has been a lot</h1>
<p>To end with a sort of cliffhanger, I think I will end here, and talk about the transitory period of my leaving Hong Kong, going to Taiwan, arriving in Belgium and beginning my new job for the next update (early February?). That way, we can do the last five solar terms and be done with it.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for reading, and thanks for enriching my life this year, whether we met IRL or just interacted online. 2022 was a pretty great year, despite having to deal with some major unpleasant moments that can only be epitomized by #Free Britney Spears’s hit single <em>Toxic</em>. Luckily, I got to lean on a select bunch of you to get through it and I’m very grateful for that.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2022-02-28-1yearversary-in-hong-kong/featured.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This post chronicles the period of September 2021 to February 2022.</p>
<p>Hooray! 🥳️🎆️ Today (28th February) marks one year <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-05-13-bird-set-free/">since I got released from quarantine</a> and got to start my post-doctoral fellowship at HKU. It has been a moving year with some very low points in the first few months but with a steady increase in happiness as the year progressed. Some glimpses of those events have been offered <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-07-30-grounding-and-arting-in-hk/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-09-24-43-days-of-summer/">here</a>, but I know most of my ardent readers have heard the stories as they happened.</p>
<p>Let’s have a retrospective from two perspectives that summarize my main life here: productivity and network</p>
<section id="productivity" class="level1">
<h1>Productivity</h1>
<p>In terms of productivity, I’m glad to say that we already have one publication out. We in this case refers to Youngah Do and Arthur Thompson. I’ve written about the paper <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/articulatory-features/">here</a> if you feel a desire to learn more about correlations between articulatory gestures and semantic features.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of us celebrating our acceptance in <em>Cognitive Linguistics</em>.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/51737395384/in/album-72177720297012796/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51737395384_7299d3251f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="766" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I’ve also done quite a lot of reviews for other papers, namely for 8 articles with multiple rounds for most of them. It has been interesting to “be on the other side” of the author-reviewer interface. I’m not convinced that they are two sides of the same coin. However, I can share that one of the authors (or team of authors?) sent a very kind message that they really appreciated the way the reviewers had done their job. So while I’ve had to face a learning curve in reviewing, I think my style has become better over the year. Sorry for the one paper I rejected but congrats to the ones that got major revisions or even better. I’m somewhat proud to already have seen some of the articles in print.</p>
<p>And I must say, I actually enjoy reviewing – there is a certain excitement or arousal when confronted with new ideas. So I hope for more review opportunities this year (<em>but not too much</em>).</p>
<p>Here is a picture of my Reviewer 1 face.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/51903582975/in/album-72177720297012796/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51903582975_b0f747f50d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>There’s of course also lots of projects in the work. And if often feels like juggling many balls. In other words, it can feel a bit overwhelming or like drowning in a bath of project balls. You will see the picture this metaphor leads to in a bit. Or scroll down now and find out now.</p>
<p>But I the point I want to make is that there are ways to stay on top of different projects. I find myself most productive working deeply on one or two at the same time rather than multitasking all the time. To help me do that, I use a combination of my bullet journal (let me know if you want me to make a blogpost about that), google calendar and a simple kanban system that involves post-it notes but that can also be implemented in systems like notion. Once again, let me know if you want me to talk about that, I love talking about academic workflow tips and tricks, and I know I’m not the only one. For instance, my <em>kōhai</em> 後輩 from Japanology Ann-Sofie is building a business out of giving tips for effective planning, <a href="https://plan-a.tips/">check out Plan A here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the picture of me metaphorically drowning in a pool of multitasking balls. I smile because I have dealt with it.</p>

<h1>Network</h1>
<p>Especially in the latter half of 2021 I have made quite a few new friends, and that has been a very good web of support for events that were to come.</p>

<p>For instance Halloween, which I spent with my Korean friend Jinyoung. She came to Lamma where it is apparently a big deal to celebrate it. I really loved seeing all the costumes. We didn’t really dress up, but here are some pictures that will give you an impression.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="christmas-and-new-year">Christmas and New Year</h2>
<p>For Christmas and New Year I hosted friends at my place. The deal was simple: I would make dessert and they would cook all the rest. And an even better part of the deal was that we had different cuisines from across Asia: China, Korea and Japan (in no particular order I love you all equally).</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/51782597565/in/album-72177720297012796/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51782597565_089ae245c6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="766" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>For New Year my Japanese friend Tomo came over again and this time I was treated to a full-blown Japanese dinner. This was after we had eaten pizza so of course we couldn’t finish it. But on the upside, we had food for a few days after the event.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/51903005063/in/album-72177720297012796/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51903005063_e15d65fee9_b.jpg" width="768" height="1024" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>But it wasn’t the only Christmas party I went to. In fact, I had a wonderful Christmas Eve: I was <a href="https://youtu.be/avaSdC0QOUM">on a boat</a>, with the CJ highschool crew. I had a good time.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/51782570835/in/album-72177720297012796/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51782570835_330b031c48_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>And I also went over to my supervisor Youngah’s place. Jinyoung had told me to memorize the phrase <em>chodaehae jusyeoseo gamsahabnidaang</em> 초대해 주셔서 감사합니다앙, which means “thanks for inviting me”. Luckily it maps well on the meter of <em>Jingle Bells</em> so I was able to do so. The food was also really good.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/51782356114/in/album-72177720297012796/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51782356114_4a239c8456_b.jpg" width="1024" height="768" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>And speaking of good food: also with other friends from school we had some really nice dinners. I didn’t take a picture of the food at Christmas but at Thanksgiving – which was the first time I celebrated that, like ever – we had a big turkey. With the magic of perspective it looks even bigger.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/51736998063/in/album-72177720297012796/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51736998063_a9856f19cf_b.jpg" width="929" height="1024" alt="Untitled"></a>

<p>And at the end of 2021 I also found myself part of a pubquiz team, which has been pretty fun as well. Our team name is “I thought it was a disco”, which is a welcome change from the typical “Jezus Kwistus” I get back in Belgium. Here’s a picture of us being victorious.</p>

<p>In the start of 2022 we also said goodbye to Szeto and Ian, two members of our short-but-interesting-lived TypoClub. So Ian, Szeto, Gabor and I had a goodbye lunch for Szeto (going to Italy) and Ian (going to Sweden). Given the current stringent covid measures in Hong Kong I don’t know when I will see them again.</p>

<p>I also said goodbye to one of my office mates, Jackie, who has been very fun to work across from. Luckily we still have Gabe and Anna to talk to. Well, after this covid wave ends. Here is a picture of the four musketeers on Lamma. Good memories and better times.</p>

<p>I also appreciate the other friends that have made my life richer. For instance, shoutout to Maggie and Sasha (🇺🇦️) for being so full of wisdom. Maybe it helped that we were also full of Flammkuchen.</p>

<p>And of course Dasha, Rita and Anna. The occasional hangout has meant a lot to me. I love how we can vent about life to each other. And also enjoy the simple comfort that a blanket brings. #blanketlyfe (It was really cold in Hong Kong the past few weeks.)</p>

<p>I learned a lot. For instance, while the hermetic law of as above so below has a truth to it, the law of as within so without is something I no longer find true in certain contexts. Go ponder on that one reader, and let me know if you want to discuss it further.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the staycation!</p>
<p>I got these coupons last year from the hotel I did my 21 day quarantine at, and they were expiring. So I did a staycation in a fancy room on the 78th floor in an executive suite. Honestly, I just came for the bathtub and the view, both of which were excellent. Here is the view.</p>

<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2022-02-13-articulatory-features/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>One of the best things of my postdoc at HKU has been the collaboration with <a href="http://hub.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp02160">Youngah Do</a> and <a href="https://hku-hk.academia.edu/ArthurLewisThompson">Arthur Lewis Thompson</a>. At the end of 2021 our first paper was published: “Articulatory features of phonemes pattern to iconic meanings: Evidence from cross-linguistic ideophones”.</p>
<p>I will give the abstract first, and then give you a few different options to engage with it. Think of it as your own RPG game!</p>
<section id="abstract" class="level1">
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Iconic words are supposed to exhibit imitative relationships between their linguistic forms and their referents. Many studies have worked to pinpoint sound-to-meaning correspondences for ideophones from different languages. The correspondence patterns show similarities across languages, but what makes such language-specific correspondences universal, as iconicity claims to be, remains unclear. This could be due to a lack of consensus on how to describe and test the perceptuo-motor affordances that make an iconic word feel imitative to speakers.</p>
<p>We created and analysed a database of 1,860 ideophones across 13 languages, and found that seven articulatory features, physiologically accessible to all spoken language users, pattern according to semantic features of ideophones. Our findings pave the way for future research to utilize articulatory properties as a means to test and explain how iconicity is encoded in spoken language. The perspective taken here fits in with ongoing research of embodiment, motivation, and iconicity research, three major strands of research within Cognitive Linguistics. The results support that there is a degree of unity between the concepts of imitative communication and the spoken forms through cross-domain mappings, which involve physical articulatory movement.</p>

<p>I don’t often see poetry books that immediately make me go <em>OMG must have</em> but <a href="https://www.theworldofchinese.com/2021/12/poet-shangyang-fang-on-avoiding-tokenizing-shoeboxes-when-writing-in-english/">this interview</a> with poet Fāng Shāngyáng 方商羊 piqued my interest, especially when I saw he had written a poem called 轰隆隆 <em>is the sound of thunder</em>.</p>
<section id="fang-shangyang" class="level1">
<h1>Fang Shangyang</h1>
<p>Fang’s debut collection <em>Burying the mountain</em> is available since the end of October of 2021, and a copy of it currently finds itself in my shopping cart, patiently awaiting the moment I decide to pull the trigger and press the button which will send it on its way to me. So far, I haven’t but the day is definitely drawing closer.</p>
<p>In any case, you can find more about the poet from <a href="https://twitter.com/shangyangfang">his twitter</a> or the collection from <a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/burying-the-mountain-by-shangyang-fang/">the publisher</a>. Currently, that page features him reading some of his work in a video, which I will embed here first.</p>

<p>While there is something in the way he’s reading poetry that I find slightly off-putting, I can’t help but respect how he appears to be visibly captivated by his own writing. Admirable.</p>

<h1>Thunder only happens when it’s raining</h1>
<p>However, Fang is maybe not why you’re here! You’re perhaps wondering why I am writing about him and his work on this blog. When I saw in the aforementioned interview that he had written a poem entitled 轰隆隆 <em>is the sound of thunder</em>, I knew I had to see what that was all about. After all, I have a greater-than-average interest in Chinese onomatopoeias and ideophones. And I also happen to have written about iconicity in meteorological expressions before!</p>
<p>In my paper <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/cose/4/2/article-p230_230.xml">“Does the thunder roll? Mandarin Chinese meteorological expressions and their iconicity”</a> (Van Hoey 2018, doi: 10.1163/23526416-00402003) (<strong><em>Contact me if you want to read a copy but you don’t have access</em></strong>), I talk about the two kinds of motivation that we can observe in weather-related ideophones.</p>
<p><strong>A first kind</strong>, let’s call them <em>colloquial ideophones</em>, are formally marked in their phonology, mostly through different types of reduplication (full and partial). The way iconicity or sound symbolism works in these words is that when you try to map aspects of the sound on the meaning of the expressions and notice a resemblance. For instance, the back vowels and nasals /oŋ/ in <em>hōnglónglóng</em> perhaps evoke the rumbling (notice the back vowel and nasal in <em>r<strong>um</strong>bling</em>) of thunder. Or in ablaut ideophones like <em>xīlī huālā</em> or <em>dīdī dādā</em> you get that alternating “over here (high vowel /i,i/) … over there (low vowel /a,a/)” effect. Combined with the fricatives of /x/ and /h/, it’s easy to imagine a kind of sluicing rainfall in <em>xīlī huālā</em>. And then l- reduplication is well-known in Chinese as a marker of continuation. Compare this to the unaspirated alveolar /d/’s of <em>dīdī dādā</em> that indicate <a href="https://youtu.be/SOKGZb38e5c">drips and drops</a>.</p>
<p>Just so we’re clear, I’m not saying these words are compositional in the way Hamano has argued for Japanese, but conversely that I can see how structural mappings can be identified or imagined.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>hōnglónglóng</em> (轟)隆 隆 ‘sound of thunder’</li>
<li><em>xīlī huālā</em> 唏 哩 嘩 啦 ‘streaming and sluicing, heavy rainfall’</li>
<li><em>dīdī dādā</em> 滴 滴 答 答 ‘lighter rainfall, just beginning or about to end’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The second kind</strong>, <em>literary ideophones</em> by lack of a better term also typically display formal phonological markedness (full or partial reduplication) and also sometimes some phonesthemic-like elements. However, what sets them apart is that they can rely more on <strong>radical support</strong>. Radical support is the idea that the graphical form of a (Chinese) word contains a semantic element that is expressed, often repeated, that indicates something about the meaning of that word. Most people know that onomatopoeia (sound ideophones) in Mandarin often have a 口 MOUTH element, e.g., <em>jījī zhāzhā</em> 嘰嘰喳喳 ‘sound of birds chirping; sound of people chattering’. But literary ideophones typically have other radicals. In the examples below WATER 氵 and RAIN ⻗. They are also typically older and not as in use in spoken language as the colloquial ones; but of course, they often turn up in song lyrics, sung in karaoke bars. So I wouldn’t flat out say they don’t belong to the contemporary Chinese, just that there is a genre effect.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>línlín</em> 淋淋 ‘streaming and sluicing; dash and splatter’</li>
<li><em>línlí</em> 淋漓 ‘light drizzle’</li>
<li><em>màimù</em> 霢霂 ‘soaked and steeped’</li>
<li><em>fēifēi</em> 霏霏 ‘heavy snowfall or rainfall’</li>
<li><em>pīlì</em> 霹靂 ‘thunderclap, thunderbolt’</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="hōnglónglóng-is-the-sound-of-thunder" class="level1">
<h1><em>Hōnglónglóng</em> is the sound of thunder</h1>
<p>Anyways, I can go on and on about these words but it’s now time to turn back to Fang Shangyang and his 轰隆隆 <em>is the sound of thunder</em>. I will present the poem below, which, in the spirit of fair use and commentary on (please Shangyang Fang or publishing house, I do this out of love and don’t come back to sue me, I hope you sell many copies), I have augmented with pinyin in red so as to show how to pronounce these words and so that you can enjoy the poem to its fullest.</p>
<p>Also, pay attention to what kind of ideophones are used here. They virtually all belong to the colloquial stratum, which tells you that indeed, we should be reading the poem out loud to make most sense of it.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope the lay-out matches that of the original poem but I can’t be sure. Just know that it’s supposed to have a few lines per paragraph usually.</p>
<p>Okay, enjoy!</p>

  <title>Tidymodels, interactions and anova - a short tutorial</title>
  <dc:creator>Thomas Van Hoey</dc:creator>
  <link>https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-10-12-tidymodels-interactions/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-10-12-tidymodels-interactions/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The past month or so, I’ve become increasingly intrigued by the <a href="https://tidymodels.org/">tidymodels</a> framework for doing modeling in R, especially after hearing an interview with Julia Silge on the <a href="https://nssdeviations.com/">Not so standard deviations</a> podcast with Roger Peng and Hilary Parker.</p>
<p>I envision myself writing more posts on this framework and applications to case studies from linguistics, but since this is the first post, I’ll just share some thoughts I currently have regarding tidymodels.</p>
<section id="tidymodels-first-thoughts" class="level1">
<h1>Tidymodels: first thoughts</h1>
<ul>
<li>Just like with the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>, I love the modularity and relatively clear sequence of steps that can guide you through “any” analysis. Although, we’re not quite there yet in terms of straightforward applicability.</li>
<li>I love the tutorials and the “tidytuesday” series on YouTube. Those case studies really provide excellent showcases for how to do common things.</li>
<li>The idea of making the interfaces to different models more uniform so you can be more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk metaphor for a second:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conceptual metaphor of DATA IS MONEY, expressed in phrasings like <em>You need to spend your data budget wisely</em> are helpful. I generally don’t see studies in linguistics that split the data first in a training and testing data set, although we probably should be doing that.</li>
<li>The conceptual metaphor of PREPPING DATA IS FOLLOWING A RECIPE (the <a href="https://recipes.tidymodels.org/">recipes</a> package ) is highly amusing and makes sense.</li>
<li>The evocative names of the <a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/packages/">other packages in the core tidymodels set</a> are good too: <code>rsample</code> for resampling, <code>parsnip</code> for modeling (this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsnip">parsnip</a>, in Dutch it’s called <em>pastinaak</em>), <code>workflows</code> for defining workflows, <code>tune</code> for tuning, <code>yardstick</code> for measing performance of your models, <code>broom</code> for cleaning the output of models…</li>
</ul>
<p>What I don’t super like about tidymodels, is that as of yet, sometimes it’s very hard to see what some tidymodels equivalents to super common modeling operations are.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, I don’t really know how to do an Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) within tidymodels, even though the Principle Components Analysis (PCA) is very well represented in the tutorials and examples. I’ve tried some <code>recipes::step_dummy()</code> to get to similar results as I would have gotten with <code>FactoMineR</code> or <code>ca</code>, but I find the results not similar enough to surrender my dimension reductions for qualitative variables completely to tidymodels. <strong>(Julia Silge and friends, if you are reading this, please figure this out for me.)</strong></li>
<li>I kind of hate that most analyses just stop at the “Oh I collected the metrics, time to turn off my computer” moment. I don’t think the analysis is finished after calculating a model’s performance; this interpretation is often lacking, and I don’t know if that’s a general quirk of data scientists or just specific to the showcases of these packages, but I wish it didn’t stop there.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, we come to the topic of this post: how do I decide whether or not to keep interaction effects.</strong> In “normal” modeling, this is quite straightforward:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Step 1. Make a model with multiple predictors, no interaction.

Step 2. Make another model with the supposed interaction.

Step 3. anova(model1, model2).
If the p value is significant, 
the more complex model (the one with the interaction) is what you want.</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="but-what-about-the-tidymodels-approach-to-anovas" class="level1">
<h1>But what about the tidymodels approach to anovas?</h1>
<p>Googling “tidymodels anova” will bring you to a lot of pages. Unfortunately, they are not super useful in answering our question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>RQ. How do I do a simple comparison of models to decide if the interaction is valid?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://broom.tidymodels.org/reference/tidy.anova.html">This page</a> takes you to a <code>broom</code> function; <a href="https://www.tmwr.org/compare.html">this one</a> to the excellent <em>Tidy modeling with R</em> book, more specifically, the chapter on comparing models with resampling. And I agree, resampling seems a very good way to compare models, and I’ve tried to apply that that page to the case study I will present below (nothing too crazy, just the <code>iris</code> dataset), but if I follow the guides there, I end up with no difference between the model with and without interactions, which is not what our anova will say. So yeah. 🤷️</p>

<p>What I will be investigating, is if Petal.Length can be predicted by Petal.Width and the Species. But we want to know if there is an interaction between Petal.Width and Species. In other words, our main model will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width + (or *) Species</code></pre>

<p>We can see three nice groups of Species. Our general linear model smooth (orange) doesn’t seem too bad, but it doesn’t take into account that there may be an interaction between the Species and the Petal.Width, as evidenced by the three different slopes per Species.</p>

<p>This is kind of the big difference compared to the normal modeling. We split the data (and you can even make folds, but that’s not for today) so that we can gauge the model’s effectiveness later on, before reporting the model itself.</p>

<p>Notice that we manually create dummy variables (<code>step_dummy</code>) for all categorical predictors. In this case that’s just Species. We also center the numerical predictors because that’s generally a good idea. For the second model, we just have to add one extra step, that is declaring the interactions. You can check the results of this recipe with the <code>prep()</code> function which can then be followed by the <code>bake(new_data = NULL)</code> function to see it in action.</p>

<p>So, tidymodels is definitely a longer style of analysis but you can get much more out of your data. And isn’t that what we ultimately want? We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>shown that indeed the interaction is there: the petal width can predict the petal length, but there is an influence of the species</li>
<li>made a model that is protected against overfitting</li>
<li>tested said model against some of the data in the model (so we know it’s more robust)</li>
<li>observed the fit of the model (R²)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these are “just plants” (sorry biased, love languages and I couldn’t get my mint to sprout so may still be vengeful about that). But now there’s a tutorial on how to do simple anova within a tidymodels framework for deciding if you should keep an interaction or not.</p>

<section id="disclaimer-on-the-iris-data-set" class="level1">
<h1>Disclaimer on the iris data set</h1>
<p>In recent years, it has become more public knowledge that the ubiquitous <code>iris</code> data set was first published in the <em>Annals of Eugenics</em> in 1936 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#Eugenics">Ronald Fisher</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/kareem_carr/status/1271096239103369224?lang=en">this tweet</a> and <a href="https://armchairecology.blog/iris-dataset/">this post</a> point out, it’s perhaps not the best thing that this data set is so readily used in data examples. Some proposals for other data sets can be found <a href="https://www.meganstodel.com/posts/no-to-iris/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, <strong>eugenics is bad</strong> – think of how important this issue was to the projected future in Star Trek with Khan and friends – and I agree that <code>iris</code> is kind of boring. But, just like the <em>Annals of Eugenics</em> rebranded itself to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Human_Genetics"><em>Annals of Human Genetics</em></a>, distancing themselves from that terrible phase in science (and we still see the beast rear its head once in a while), I can’t help but think that this silly description of flowers is quite innocent. Perhaps, death of the scholar does exist? After all, if we have to throw away <code>iris</code> because of Fisher’s bad personal views (once again, not good), do we also have to throw out the stats techniques he developed? I know that I’ve used the Fisher-Yates Exact Test to calculate mutual attraction.</p>
<p>And let’s also talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson">Karl Pearson</a>, who was the first editor of the <em>Annals of Eugenics</em>. Reading up on his wiki bio was not pleasant either. So should we throw out the Pearson correlation? Or even worse: the p-value (which was first <em>formally</em> introduced in the Pearson’s chi-square test)? Gone with Principled Components Analysis! Histograms? History you mean!</p>
<p>The point is that it is necessary to treat the data and work as separate from their personal life. That means that I agree with the efforts to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher#Reappraisal_of_his_contentious_views_on_race_and_eugenics">rename buildings that were named after Fisher</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson#Politics_and_eugenics">Pearson</a> at UCL, but that at the same time we should still be okay with using <code>iris</code> or statistical techniques developed by these people. The best two arguments for not using <code>iris</code> are that it’s boring and that there exists a <code>penguins</code> dataset (<a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/">found here</a>).</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-09-24-43-days-of-summer/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-07-30-grounding-and-arting-in-hk/">previous post</a> I went over my first few months of settling in Hong Kong. Today it’s time to talk about my first visitor and the amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_Days_of_Summer">43 days of summer</a> we spent. Of course I’m talking about CJ!</p>
<hr>
<p>Just like all people entering Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/world/asia/nicole-kidman-hong-kong.html">except for Nicole Kidman</a>, CJ had to do quarantine. The hotel was the same as the one I had stayed in during my voluntary confinement, so it was quite decent. But going over there to drop off some survival packages for him provided me with a complementary perspective: I got to see the hotel from the outside, knowing full well what went down behind that barrier that I couldn’t pass. It was weird to be so close yet so far, after almost a year.</p>
<p>On 1 August CJ got out of his 14-day quarantine, so I took a ferry to fetch him. Seeing him emerge from the check-out counter was really joyous for both of us: <em>oof</em>, we had made it. As his first post-quarantine meal he had decided on Shake Shack hamburgers (I had done so too), so we went to the IFC, one of the Two Towers of Hong Kong and feasted on food and views — Shake Shack is located on the rooftop of the IFC.</p>

<p>Next came the perilous journey to Lamma. As soon as we set sail (okay, okay, we didn’t do that much sailsetting but rather sat inside in the AC-controlled room, enjoying the polar temperatures that are so common for Hong Kong), it started POURING. In fact, it was raining so badly that we could see cats and dogs falling out of the sky, just short of a sharknado. As we got to Lamma, the weather app informed us that, indeed, locally on Lamma there was an extreme amount of raindrops <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sySlY1XKlhM">that kept falling on our heads</a>. Don’t believe, here’s a pic because it did happen. And this was when it had already subsided a bit. Eventually we made it up the mountain and we could just be at ease.</p>

<p>Over the next few days we slowly slid into a daily rhythm. I had to work and so did CJ so we did spend a lot of time together in my of office. While those daily moments were fun, that is probably not why you’re here, dear reader, so I won’t dilly-dally nor beat around any bushes, but just take you on a tour of the highlights.</p>

<p>Since we basically had to cram a year of not seeing each other in 43 days, we had a lot of good food and coffee. Here are pictures (insert thousands of words).</p>

<p>First up is the Monopoly exhibition on the Peak. I had always suspected it was a tourist trap and my suspicions were confirmed. But I’m happy CJ was willing to indulge in my wish to go there. It was expensive, but they had a fun money grabbing game in the installation which kinda made it worth it. Also the history of the game by itself. If anybody ever wants to play Monopoly with me, I’m down~</p>

<p>We also went to Discovery Bay, which is probably best described as Club Med in Hong Kong or Center Parcs HK. It’s where CJ grew up and for kids that looks like a super safe and nice community. We visited his old primary school and also the house he lived in the longest there. I love doing house tours. Anyways, pictured here are the central plaza with the Pacific Coffee CJ used to get LAN internet from and the DB beach.</p>

<p>One day, we also went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Buddha_(Hong_Kong)">Big Buddha</a>. It was <a href="https://sinologica.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/hong-kong-geurige-thuishaven/">not the firs time I had been there</a>, but it would be the first time taking the cable car – last time we had taken a bus. The first picture is us in our cable car. In the second one you can spot him on the left.</p>

<p>But to our astonishment, the Buddha was under construction! Luckily it did not dampen our fun. We took pictures with the free-roaming cows and statues of the 12 arhats, and still climbed up to his bodhiness.</p>

<p>There was also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po_Lin_Monastery">Po Lin monastery</a> which was pretty beautiful (and I have seen many Chinese temples so I have a frame of reference). Adding to the athmosphere was the praying of the monks that could be heard from outside of their hall which we weren’t allowed to enter.</p>

<p>Chi Lin Nunnery and the adjacent Nanlian Garden, which I have visited a few times before (just look at previous blogs), also had the honour of being frequented by us. And we had the honour of witnessing the golden pavilion.</p>

<p>The nunnery itself is also nice; it’s a kind of fake old temple which is an acquired aesthetic.</p>

<h1>Lamma Lyfe</h1>
<p>Some final moments of our life on Lamma. First there was the ghost month. People will leave out offerings to the ghosts in exchange for luck. But, as my hair stylist warned me, it’s best not to touch the offerings or even sing while going up during ghost month. Very dangerous.</p>
<p>I remember in Taipei they also stayed away from bodies of water, lest the ghosts would snatch you in and turn you into a ghost. <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gastly_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Ghastly.</a></p>

<p>This was the caption for the picture that we took right before CJ went in for customs and to catch his flight. Once again, we were separated by barriers I couldn’t pass.</p>

<p>I can only reiterate that, in the words of Vance Joy, whose music you really need to be in the mood for because it’s basically all variations of the same song but that one song is so good, in this iteration, you’re the missing puzzle piece, and I can’t wait until we’re back together again.</p>

<p>Because when you’re in a room with me that missing piece is found. You know when you’re by my side darling nothing can bring us down.</p>

<p>This post is the next installment of my time spent in Hong Kong. The first installment, <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-05-13-bird-set-free/">Bird set free</a>, talked about how I did my 21 days of quarantine and the subsequent 30 days of freedom. In this post, I’ll go over the period of April to July 2021.</p>
<p>Warning: there will be many pictures involved, and to get most out of the art at the end I’d say, take some time to stand still and record your thoughts.</p>
<section id="turning-30" class="level1">
<h1>Turning 30</h1>
<p>There’s no way around it; this year I got my ticket to get on tram 3, the way we colloquially talk about reaching this milestone. I know that so many people did not get to spend their birthdays the way they wanted in the past year or so, let alone their 30th. So I’ve been quite fortunate that neither last year nor this year a lockdown was in effect at the moment of reaching that age. Yet, I still had a number of thoughts surrounding that age (huh, but age is just a number?! yeah right…).</p>
<p>I’m proud of what I’ve been able to accomplish so far in life, given the chances afforded to me. But in Chinese there is this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucian</a> saying <em>sānshí ér lì</em> 三十而立 “At thirty, I stood firm”, meaning that you’re independent and can take care of yourself and your situation at the age of thirty. And I guess that’s kind of true in my situation, but it just didn’t feel like that.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I felt quite uprooted: in a new place, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4">no strong network of friends</a>. One might even say, I felt like I was “only thirty” (<em>sānshí ér yǐ</em> 三十而已), or maybe just felt like a new kid on the block (<em>sānshí ér yǐ</em> 三十兒立). In any case, due to circumstances, I spent the b-day alone and ended up just sitting on the beach (<em>sānshí ér zuò</em> 三十而坐) wallowed in <a href="https://youtu.be/6KiMclu8fqY">existential despair</a>. Here are two pictures of that beach that night:</p>

<p>I truly longed for the warmth of that campfire and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhXX4KzztdA">those people that night</a>, but could not bring myself to go over and join their party.</p>
<p>But I was more than pleasantly surprised that I actually have more friends than I thought here. Throughout the following two weeks or so, I met up with multiple people, and they really pulled me out of my sullen slump. And I am so grateful for that. In this time of covid, we need live interactions more than ever.</p>
<p>So thanks Darryl and family for the birthday cake.</p>

<p>And thanks Youngah for the lunch. And thanks Marcelo and Arthur for the dinner. And thanks to all the friends I’ve made or reconnected with in the past few months: Ian, Gabor, Szeto, Jinyoung, Pavel, Hengheng, Jonah, Tomo and so on and so on. You’ve really given me the sense of growing some roots here, helping me ground.</p>

<p>It has taken me a while but I’m in a better space now, and I am also extremely stoked that CJ is nearing the end of his quarantine. So August is going to be awesome!</p>

<section id="walking-in-the-mountains" class="level1">
<h1>Walking in the mountains</h1>
<p>One of the things I have been enjoying since moving to Hong Kong is leisurely strolling around my place and the place I work at. I don’t think I’m a full-on hiker, honestly, I come from Belgium and every slope is like a mountain to me okay. But I do enjoy some nice brisk walks.</p>
<p>So here I found myself walking up to Victoria Peak. (I don’t like the work <em>hike</em> in English, because in my mental vision that involves full on hiking gear with ropes and pickaxes and what have you. I don’t think we even have the meaning of ‘leisurely walking amidst the mountains’ in the Dutch equivalent <em>bergbeklimmen</em> ‘mountain-climbing’. Idk. Random thoughts.)</p>

<p>The view from the Peak was quite nice and a good reward for the upwards trek.</p>

<p>Along the way I encountered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_Battery">Pinewood battery</a>, the remnants of an air defense (built by the British). At first I was heaving and huffing from the climb, but then I regained my composture and reflected a bit about the moment. Much later I wrote a poem about it (I was a bit bored on the ferry ha).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Pinewood Battery</p>
<p>Covered by leaves, I hiked the Peak and reached a verdant clearing, pinetrees all around a central circle — batt’ries that were breached when Eastern foes took flight to higher ground.</p>
<p>The remnants ruins of that air defense once used to shoot down planes from azure sky. They witnessed fragrant bloodshed, times were tense, yet tranquil on a tourist trail they lie.</p>
<p>A ghastly whisper beckoned, contemplate the lives cut off too soon for Empires lost. Who mourns here now the dead, their restless fate, except for hikers; was it worth the cost?</p>
<p>This all in mind I ask two aunties dear, please take a picture and make sure it’s clear.</p>

<p>I’ve been also been walking around Lamma. Here are some pics from my walk to the windmill.</p>

<p>And it’s not just me who is slightly obsessed with sunsets. Every day I see lots of Hong Kongers take pictures of it, enjoying the daily dying of the light. It’s almost as if if nobody caught it on film, we couldn’t be sure that the next day the sun would make the effert to come back and shine upon us all.</p>

<p>The moons I’ve witnessed on Lamma are also nice. It’s almost as if Lamma is a manifestation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Penglai">Mount Penglai</a> or maybe even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon">Avalon</a>. The latter is more probable, as there are many British elements present there (but no apple trees).</p>

<p>I envision myself writing a poem or two about the place that is Lamma in the future. But here is a poem that I thought of when coming across this renovation site in my village (not written by me but the wonderful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_Valiente">Doreen Valiente</a>).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Redevelopment.</p>
<p>The old house vanished in a dusty cloud, its secrets scattered to the winds of air. Whether its dwellers humble were or proud, they are forgotten, and its walls stand bare.</p>
<p>Soon the last fragment’s gone. The raw earth gapes. The loud-voiced, sun-bronzed builders have moved in. Now by their hands arise new-fangled shapes, new bricks, fresh concrete, motors roaring din.</p>
<p>A new room grows, where once in the same place those others dwelt, who lived and loved and died. Who came there young, grew old, perhaps found grace with new hope now who comes here to reside?</p>
<p>So turns the wheel of time; the cycle runs for houses, years and galaxies of suns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem came to me the instant I saw that ruin. I linked it to my own uprooted state that had slowly been trying to undo that uprootedness. And I feel like I succeeded through a budding network of friends and colleagues, but also by becoming more independent. In a way I was able to undergo some internal redevelopment. What helped me was seeking out the beauty expressed by other people. In other words, I went to artsy places, trying to “art” myself – this is play on words, <em>to ground oneself</em> in Dutch is <em>aarden</em>. Naturally, grounding onself through art is then <em>to art oneself</em>.</p>

<h1>Arting myself</h1>
<p>I kept bumping into artsy spaces, so I took it as some kind of sign that I should do more of that. For instance, I decided on a whim to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Kwun">Tai Kwun</a>, and they had this really cool exhibition about the moon (also a Taschen bookstore, so nice books).</p>

<p>The only thing I did not like at all was this artwork by an artist who took pie charts to a whole new level. Like, him choosing that to be interesting shows that he hasn’t read up on how bad it is to use pie charts to compare groups. Do not do it people.</p>

<p>A while later, for French may, which weirdly comprises May <em>and</em> June, I went to the Hong Kong Museum of Art, which was hosting an exhibition <a href="https://hk.art.museum/en_US/web/ma/exhibitions-and-events/surrealism-and-beyond-masterpieces-from-centre-pompidou.html">Mythologies: Surrealism and Beyond</a>. Here are pictures of famous works:</p>

<h1>Time to sail away</h1>
<p>So there you have it. I’m doing well, and increasingly so. The communities I’m lucky to be(come) a part of are becoming more solidified, both professionally and personally – although this update has decidedly focused more on the personal part.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to take my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_(ship)">junk</a> and sail <a href="https://youtu.be/5nhRArwYvj4">away into the sunset</a>. Cheers.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I <em>twote</em> this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
Won't say I'm a pro (more like intermediate if even that much ha) but can now say that I am sufficiently familiar enough with <a href="https://twitter.com/psychopy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation" data-cites="psychopy">@psychopy</span></a> to build experiments for research on ideophones and iconicity. <br><br>But the learning route has been pretty 𝑘𝑎̌𝑛𝑘𝑒̌ 坎坷.

</blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Because <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bonniemclean/home">Bonnie McLean</a> asked for a blog about the experience and some general thoughts on the use of <a href="https://www.psychopy.org/">PsychoPy</a>, I decided to write it down. So here it is.</p>
<section id="wtf-is-psychopy" class="level1">
<h1>WTF is PsychoPy</h1>
<p>PsychoPy (Peirce et al.&nbsp;2019 <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-018-01193-y.pdf">doi: 10.3758/s13428-018-01193-y</a>) is an application for the creation of experiments in behavioral science (psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, etc.) with precise spatial control and timing of stimuli. There are two ways of creating an experiment: either by writing raw python code, or by using the Builder to get a more GUI experience (to which some code can be appended).</p>
<p>For someone with a more corpus-oriented background (<em>le moi</em>), it was looking like a daunting task to create this kind of experiments for which it was important that the reaction times etc. were controlled for. Note that other software like Qualtrics, or even Google Forms, is still great for surveys for which such control is not super relevant; but it makes sense to think that in psycholinguistics we ideally would want to capture such information in a realiable manner. There’s also a budding psycholinguistic community that is based on the Shiny framework for R, like <a href="https://ndphillips.github.io/ShinyPsych.html">ShinyPsych</a>, and I know the aforementioned Bonnie is also scripting experiments based on R, although I don’t know if its ShinyPsych.</p>
<p>So, because PsychoPy is supposedly easy to use, open source, and because it can also be deployed on its linked platform Pavlovia to actually run the experiments, it seemed like a good choice to base our experimental work on, especially in times of Covid. However, for the preparation of stimuli and the post-hoc analysis, I still turn to R.</p>
</section>
<section id="builder" class="level1">
<h1>Builder</h1>
<p>This is what a general PsychoPy experiment in the Builder view looks like.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.3758%2Fs13428-018-01193-y/MediaObjects/13428_2018_1193_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the lower box, you can see the different “<em>routines</em>” that make up the experiment. For instance, here you have the instructions ‘instructPractice’, followed by the ‘trial’ and ‘feedback’, which are repeated in a loop. Then you have some new instructions ‘instruct’, followed by the “real experiment” ‘trial’ and a loop again. Finally, a few words of thanks for participating.</p>
<p>In the upper box, you have the <strong>uniquely named</strong> components of a routine, in this case ‘trial’. You can see that there is a fixation cross present. At some point, a word stimulus will appear. People will have to press a key to respond and then the experiment will go to the next trial in the loop.</p>
<p>So the general buildup is pretty explanatory, and you find heaps of videos on youtube that show the basic anatomy. On of my favorites is the following, on creating a word based reaction time study (watch at your own pace, or as the Japanese say <em>mai peesu de</em> マイペースで):</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQ6Bhj7OILk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
<p>Following along with such instructional videos can get you up and running pretty fast, although it felt like a struggle because I had to start from scratch. Below I’ll list some things that were not super obvious to me in the beginning. But first, deploying the experiment online.</p>
</section>
<section id="deploying-and-running-on-pavlovia" class="level1">
<h1>Deploying and running on Pavlovia</h1>
<p>One of the selling points of PsychoPy is the supposed seamless integration with a platform called <a href="https://pavlovia.org/">Pavlovia</a>. You can upload your experiment to this platform, pilot the experiment and finally run it. You do have to pay for running it, but the credits are not very expensive, and you only have to pay for the experiments that are completed; so not for participants that somewhere along the way leave.</p>
<p>Since it was not super intuitive of how to actually deploy the experiment, I once again turned to youtube. Luckily, there were some good demo videos for this aspect as well. My favorite, which helped me the most, is this series by a certain Jordan Gallant:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/UULoyXVLqz4">Intro</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/8AcNwLzBwPA">Pavlovia account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/wXcoozHkHHE">Uploading an experiment</a></li>
<li>(<a href="https://youtu.be/OO3nE1m8CpY">Sharing an experiment</a>)</li>
<li>(<a href="https://youtu.be/NtL7hbay-4k">Basic git commands</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>And now after running the first experiment, I can see say that it works and is accurate enough.</p>
</section>
<section id="community" class="level1">
<h1>Community</h1>
<p>Another aspect that I haven’t touched on yet, is the community. Most people familiar with R or python or what have you know that this aspect is actually quite important. From my mentioning of youtube you can already gauge that there is some vibrancy concerning PsychoPy, but it’s not until you head to <a href="https://discourse.psychopy.org/">https://discourse.psychopy.org/</a> that you can really find out how thriving it actually is. People will ask questions about errors they face, much like stack overflow, and some of the issues I encountered were indeed answered there (yet not all, spoiler). But so this makes for another compelling reason of why PsychoPy may be a good vehicle for your experiments.</p>
</section>
<section id="not-very-obvious-aspects" class="level1">
<h1>Not very obvious aspects</h1>
<p>Here is a series of issues I faced thus far.</p>
<section id="which-kind-stimulus-must-i-use" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-kind-stimulus-must-i-use">1. Which kind stimulus must I use</h2>
<p>Perhaps it is because of my background, but it is not always very clear what component of the builder I have to use to get what I want. For instance, figuring out the button or radio boxes is quite hard, and I eventually found other ways of doing it, because I couldn’t figure it out.</p>
</section>
<section id="textobject-is-not-text" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="textobject-is-not-text">2. TextObject is not Text</h2>
<p>In the builder you can find two components that seem pretty similar, TextObject and Text. However, they are not the same: TextObject has many more variables you can set, like having a border around your text object (which is pretty crucial in my opinion). While TextObject, at the time of writing, has a small ‘beta’ sticker on top of it, it appeared to me as the new and improved text stimulus go-to. One of the main benefits of TextObject is that the text can be editable, i.e., they can act as small forms. (I don’t know what they did before this function, since that seems pretty crucial??)</p>
<p>But, as the image shows, using TextObject for non-editable text can lead to some weird situation. So better to use a Text component for that.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-20-psyched-about-psychopy/images/Schermafbeelding 2021-04-20 om 15.00.44.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="exporting-to-html" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exporting-to-html">3. Exporting to HTML</h2>
<p>In order to save space or something the default pipeline no longer creates and updates an HTML folder within your PsychoPy folder. However, things would not work for me like that (as opposed to what the forums say), so I had to change my preferences. However, they are not in the preferences, but under the wheel icon.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-20-psyched-about-psychopy/images/CleanShot 2021-05-20 at 11.55.14@2x.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Then change the path.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-20-psyched-about-psychopy/images/CleanShot 2021-05-20 at 11.56.24@2x.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Now it will work.</p>
</section>
<section id="some-code-functions-dont-work-on-pavlovia" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-code-functions-dont-work-on-pavlovia">4. Some code functions don’t work on Pavlovia</h2>
<p>Once I was finally happy that I had gotten my experiment up and running offline, I was ready to move online. However, some of the handy code components that I had introduced (by following other people’s, as all coders do), didn’t work on Pavlovia. For instance, the quitting function <code>core.quit()</code> does not work; instead you need to replace it with PsychoJS (yes PsychoPy’s own JavaScript implementation) code, like <code>psychoJS.quit()</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="general-documentation-is-not-builder-focused" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-documentation-is-not-builder-focused">5. General documentation is not builder focused</h2>
<p>I wish the documentation on the website was a bit more visual rather than code-based; as they are promoting this as a “you can build it” kind of software, it was a bit of a hurdle to get over all the technical description of component settings. But it’s not a hurdle that’s too high.</p>

</iframe>
<p>
<a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/bob-the-builder-yes-we-can-UxNTT095uL0go">via GIPHY</a>
</p>
</section>
<section id="randomization" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="randomization">6. Randomization</h2>
<p>There are still aspects of randomization I can’t figure out, mostly involving counterbalancing. Perhaps in due time I will find a way to do it.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="other-handy-resources" class="level1">
<h1>Other handy resources</h1>
<p>Luckily the community is quite good, so there are some documents that help you set up the experiment and “translate” it to Pavlovia.</p>
<p>Two must-reads are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13jp0QAqQeFlYSjeZS0fDInvgaDzBXjGQNe4VNKbbNHQ/edit?usp=sharing">the 2020 cribsheet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/183xmwDgSbnJZHMGf3yWpieV9Bx8y7fOCm3QKkMOOXFQ/edit?usp=sharing">the updated 2021 cribsheet</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So all in all I’m quite happy we are using PsychoPy. Having become familiar with the basic functions has enabled me to set up experiments, in such a way that analysis afterwards is clear and reproducible. There is a learning curve, but there is also a supportive community to help out.</p>

  <title>Bird set free</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-13-bird-set-free/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This post chronicles my time spent in quarantine in Hong Kong back in February and my subsequent release and first month free in March 2021. The title of the post is inspired by Sia’s song <em>Bird set free</em>, although I must admit that <em>I know why the caged bird sings</em> (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_Why_the_Caged_Bird_Sings">Maya Angelou</a>) was a strong contender for a title as well.</p>

<section id="flying-from-be-to-hk" class="level1">
<h1>Flying from BE to HK</h1>
<p>As I detailed in <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/2021-02-26-et-in-arcadia-ego/">this post</a>, I spent the latter half and the first month of 2021 or so in Belgium, back home, and loved it. But I was also getting excited for moving to Hong Kong for my new job at HKU. This was not an easy getaway. Not only did I have to apply for the work visa and all other necessary documents; but in times of covid I would also need to have tests taken at the right time within the right window to even be allowed to use the plane ticket that I also paid for.</p>
<p>So there I was, within my 72 hour window before my flight, lining up outside, between the cars in the drive-through covid test site in Brasschaat. The cold made the depth reached by the unnecessary long stick up my nose hurt even worse and I felt a phantom pain as I was making my way back.</p>
<p>Fast forward two days. Hooray, a negative test, now off to Brussels Airport, where I had to take a fast test to enter the Netherlands, which was unnecessary and stupid, but required. 40 minutes later this also gave me a negative test result and I could finally board the plane from Brussels to Amsterdam. Going up. Going down.</p>
<p>Then I had to wait for quite a while and finally got ready to board. It didn’t look like it was going to be a full flight, but maybe a lot of people were late? Anyway, we had to show yet once again all the million test results and right documents, so we could board the plane.</p>
<p>As it turned out, there were only four passengers, and 10 crew members. Unfortunately, one of the four of us had decided to pay for an upgrade to business class while right before boarding and that meant that he got to enjoy all the perks that came with that, while the remaining three of us had to stay in economy. Later, on of the flight attendants told me that if he hadn’t done that, we would all have been upgraded for free. Yet, all things considered, it was a joyous flight. Here is a picture of me expressing my joy.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50964805658/in/album-72157719174851727/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50964805658_bd978217aa_h.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Untitled"></a>

<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>When we arrived at the airport, it felt like we had just entered a ghost town. A long guided trail led us from station to station. We had to show our test results, show that we had the necessary documents to enter, show that our tests were not just photoshopped, show this, show that …and finally got tested again (within my 72-hour window!!). Then we were sat at tables to await the test results and fitted with fashionable wristbands that we could not take off for the following 21 days of quarantine.</p>

<p>After being fitted with the trendy covid fitbit, I was taken to the hotel I had booked for 21 consecutive nights. I chose L’Hotel Island South – now rebranded as the <a href="https://www.ninahotelgroup.com/">Nina Hotel Island South</a> – and honestly, it was a good experience, given the circumstances. People following my instagram (<span class="citation" data-cites="simazhi">@simazhi</span> y’all) could see daily updates on the food + ratings. Here’s a small selection.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I should probably also mention that by this point it had been 2.5 months since I had had a haircut, due to the restrictions in Belgium and also quarantine. So expect to see some wild hairstyles in this post.</p>
<p>I was surprised a number of times during my stay at the hotel, two of which had to do with the wonderful care packages from my current boss <a href="http://hub.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp02160">Dr.&nbsp;Youngah Do</a>. Words cannot express the happiness I felt at receiving this.</p>

<p>Emotionally, though, the lack of real world contact was quite hard. It’s one thing to see other people on a computer screen and interact with them, but I was so happy every time I caught a rare glimpse of a hotel staff member delivering food. And the tests on day 17 and 20 were also kind of enjoyable, since I got to interact with real humans, who talked back to me, in real life and proximity. There was also a fun little gimmick in the hotel: a delivery from a robot.</p>

<p>I mean, the robot delivery was a fun activity but real interaction is still best. And it didn’t help that I could see people from my window, all the way down (I was on the 23th floor) in the distance. I tried to still my feelings about this aspect of life that had suddenly been taken away from me by not focusing on the world outside, even though the weather was so good those days. My cage was a physical containment, but the mind can wander and I developed a meditation practice, but also watched like half of Netflix.</p>

<p>Finally, the day came that it was my final day. When the clock struck 00:00, I did not lose my glass shoe but instead took off my covid fitbit tracker, deleted the Stay Home Safe app, and felt a huge weight lifte off my back.</p>

<p>Yet, the next day, as I prepared my luggage for leaving, I felt a bit 捨不得 ‘reluctant to say goodbye’. I once again took pictures of every corner of my room, and to this day still think of the gingo leaf painting that was my only fixed view for 21 days. But then it was time to prepare the bags and take a picture with the hotel once I was out.</p>

<p>Outside, I was being picked up by my friend and colleague Dr.&nbsp;Arthur Thompson, who kindly offered me a place to sleep for the unforeseeable future, while I looked for a place to live. So we went to eat ShakeShack (first post-quarantine food) and then took the ferry to Lamma island, and then took a sunset pic on the beach.</p>

<h1>Nesting at HKU</h1>
<p>The day after my release on the 28th of February, we went to the University of Hong Kong, where I got to meet my new boss in real life again. It was very joyful and bound to lead to a good cooperation. Here is a picture of the three of us in our small iconicity and ideophones team. As well as a view from the grad students office on the 9th floor where I would take a seat for a while.</p>

<p>The homefront has told me they want to see more pictures so in this section I’m just showing a few places I went to visit in these first two months. Perhaps it is also useful to link to <a href="https://sinologica.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/hong-kong-geurige-thuishaven/">my first visit to Hong Kong in 2013</a>. If you can read Dutch then this is really a gem of a blogpost. It also lays the foundation my tourist impression of Hong Kong and explains why I visited <a href="http://www.chilin.org/">Chi Lin Nunnery 志蓮淨苑 and the adjoining Nanlian Garden 南蓮園池</a> within the first few weeks of being here.</p>

<p>For my travel companions and myself in 2013, this garden really was stunning and a well-deserved cover of the contemporary Lonely Planet guide. I find that strolling in the garden really enables me to put my mind at ease. So I’ve returned <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/memorable-moments-of-2018/">to it with CJ and Arthur in subsequent visits</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to see more pictures of this idyllic place on earth. But Hong Kong is not only Chi Lin Nunnery, lol; there’s also lots of temples. For instance, there is the <a href="https://www.man-mo-temple.hk/">Man Mo Temple 文武廟</a>, dedicated to the god of writing and literacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenchang_Wang">Man Tai 文帝</a> and the marial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guan_Yu">Mo Tai 武帝</a>. Fun fact, <em>tai</em> in Cantonese, or <em>dì</em> in Mandarin means ‘emperor’ as well and there are lots of emperors throughout history who posthumously are referred to as <em>Wéndì</em> 文帝 and <em>Wǔdì</em> 武帝.</p>
<p>When I first visited the Man Mo in 2013 I was a bit disappointed, not a lot was going on and the nice spiral incense cones we were promised in the guidebook weren’t lit at all. Things were different this time around. The day I happened to visit the temple it was super busy, and I also offered some incense to the deer statue. Deer are an interesting animal and I’ve come to appreciate them increasingly in the past few years, for instance on my trip to Japan in 2019 (for which I did not write a blogpost??).</p>

<p>I also love going to see some art (mostly painting or sculpture). And discovering that HKU has a university museum with exhibitions was kind of nice. I got to see Ng Lung Wai’s <a href="https://www.umag.hku.hk/en/exhibition_detail.php?id=1843487">Painting across the threshold</a>, where he uses a folding paint technique. Very cool effect.</p>

<h1>Roosting on Lamma</h1>
<p>It became clear quite early on that I was interested in settling on Lamma Island. And even though this island has snakes, bugs and wild boar, it’s also quite vibrant and fun to escape the city on a daily basis. I still love the ferry commute, although it’s quite a journey to go to work, but I love the view of seeing Hong Kong in all its vertical concrete glory rise up as I approach it.</p>

  <title>Setting up a clean project: the best practice I use</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I’ve been settling in at my <a href="https://linguistics.hku.hk/ldlhku/people/">new job at the Language Development Lab at HKU</a>, which I started physically in March 2021. I will soon do an update on my time in Hong Kong since then, but this post is written with future me in mind. A big part of my job is to work out the practical implementations of experiments, and that has thus far involved managing the project structure, designing psychopy experiments, and post-experiment analysis in R. This seems like a nice trilogy of technical posts, and I hope to deliver to you (and future me). Today’s special on the menu is automating the set-up of a project.</p>
<section id="why-worry-about-this" class="level1">
<h1>Why worry about this</h1>
<p>Most people that are not very code minded have a vague idea of what a folder on their computer should look like and will let the structure of the subfolders automatically emerge. Perhaps you tell yourself you will remember which version is the “real final one” and that some of the figures are in that other folder somewhere else on your computer in that one powerpoint slide and that some data can be found under a rock, if you look closely, and oh no it was not the final version after all and you need to make some changes so you add a date, then go find some more data and then remember that maybe if you change a little bit here and there it might be a better version but it’s on the same date, so now it’s today’s date but with an ‘a’ behind it so you will remember and then you’re kinda sure it’s the <em>final-final</em> version so you save it but when you come back next week it turns out there is an even <em>finaler</em> version but then luckily you’re finished.</p>

</p>
<p>You come back to that document because there was something in it and luckily you still have all versions on your computer but which version is “the real final version”? <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Joost_mag_het_weten">Joost might know it.</a></em> All you find is the following structure:</p>
<p><img src="https://doctorfreelance.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/file-naming.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And even though <a href="https://doctorfreelance.com/file-naming-conventions/">the post</a> this picture was featured on lists some great tips to avoid the most important versioning issues – I am also privy to using DATE extensions when working with other people in MS Word, e.g., “paperstudy_20210512.docx” – the burden can be alleviated by using a version control system like github. I’ve done that for my dissertation and it has been very useful to retrieve older sections, but it did make revisions and comments from my supervisor, who preferred MS Word, more difficult, as we had to settle on PDF and the comment system there. There is less friction with the track-changes and comment functions in MS Word than with PDF, but I think I would still prefer a versioning system.</p>
<p>Anyway, an organically grown folder structure may be clear in the moment, but your future self will curse you, or even worse, hex you. The answer to avoiding a lot of future project pain is having a structure that is easy to set up, and is flexible to suit a particular project’s needs.</p>
</section>
<section id="best-practices" class="level1">
<h1>Best practices</h1>
<p>Just googling for something like ‘R project structure best practices’ will result in a number of very interesting blogs that advocate what a project folder <del>could</del> should look like. For instance, <em>Nice R Code</em> <a href="https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/">shows</a> that a good project layout ensures the integrity of the data, the portability of the project, and the support for the future usage. There’s also <em>Krista Destasio’s</em> <a href="https://kdestasio.github.io/post/r_best_practices/">best practices in R</a> or <a href="https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/10/29/an-example-directory-structure/">an example directory structure</a> on <em>Very statisticious</em>. For me, the importance of having a decent structure kicked in about 1.5 years ago, when I did a massive overhaul of my dissertation folder after seeing Jenny Bryan talk about <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/">project-oriented workflows</a>, and I wished I had started with a clear structure from the beginning. And now I can’t really see myself not making a somewhat clear structure from the beginning.</p>
<p>So what does my own best practice look like? It will be something close to the structure in this screenshot (which I will be building in today’s post, so stay tuned for that).</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-12-setting-up-a-clean-project-the-best-practice-i-use/images/docstructure.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As you can see I have quite a number of folders and files, <em>from the getgo</em>. First there is the <code>Rproj</code> file (here <code>ABB.Rproj</code>). This ensures I can use my project-oriented workflow and keep track, and also connect the code to github if I so desired and I usually desire so.</p>
<p>Next is the <code>README.md</code> file, a typical file in which you write important information you want other people to read. This is a useful piece of documentation, but if you’re not into filling that out in the beginning that’s okay too; it doesn’t take up much space lol.</p>
<p>Our first folder is the <code>data/</code> folder, which has two subfolders: <code>data/raw/</code> and <code>data/processed/</code>. The main idea is that the <code>raw/</code> folder contains original data you bring to the analysis, while the <code>processed/</code> folder acts as a dumping ground for intermediate data files, not necessarily output. The <code>processed/</code> folder is a quite new structure for me, so I don’t know if I’m going to keep it around.</p>
<p>Then we have the <code>documents/</code> folder, which should contain supporting documents, maybe some crucial papers, or a figure that’s important for the argument.</p>
<p>Next <code>figures/</code> will eventually contain figures generated by code or in powerpoint, or whatever fancy software you wish to use, like photoshop. It’s useful to have this as a separate folder because some journals will ask you to submit the figures separately.</p>
<p>Then there are the <code>notes/</code>, a place for random notes and observations.</p>
<p>There is <code>output/</code>, which ideally consists of the output data that will see the light of day in a repository, cleaned and ready for analysis. In my conception, that means that <code>output/</code> can also contain data to be read in again in a final representation of the script.</p>
<p>Next we have <code>paper/</code>. This is where I keep different versions of the paper, ideally coded with a date as mentioned above.</p>
<p>There is the <code>previous/</code> folder, in which I will periodically move older versions of the paper we don’t need in the moment but may want to keep around <em>just a little bit longer</em>. It also acts as a kind of bin, tbh.</p>
<p>And finally there is the <code>scripts/</code> folder, in which I would store all .R, .Rmd and .py or what have you files.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this structure is completely flexible and is bound to change for every project.</strong> For instance, there may be a replication component, so it is good to have a separate folder for stimuli or figures from that paper (perhaps under <code>documents/</code> but hey, you do you boo). Or if you have an experiment, like I find myself these days with Psychopy, that inevitably comes with a <code>psychopy/</code> folder.</p>
<p>So, are we good on the idea that 1) it is beneficial to work with projects? and 2) the initial project structure should something like the picture above? Okay, time to move on to the next step: workflow and automation.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-control---github" class="level1">
<h1>1) Version control - github</h1>
<p>I think it is clear by now that in most cases I would advocate for a version controlled project. That usually means I would start on Github to create a new project, as such:</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-12-setting-up-a-clean-project-the-best-practice-i-use/images/githubnewproject.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Then fill out the information for your new project. I like to start with a private repository, but that’s up to you. I would suggest adding the README file and also a .gitignore.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-12-setting-up-a-clean-project-the-best-practice-i-use/images/githubnew.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>After the project is started, if you’re on a Mac, go to the .gitignore dotfile and add the following to that file and save it. This will make sure that the very annoying .DS_Store files that a reviewer commented on in the past, won’t show up in the project. (<em>What are .DS_Store files anyway and why do they keep appearing????</em>)</p>
<pre><code># .DS_Store
.DS_Store</code></pre>
<p>Okay, now you’re all set for step 2.</p>
</section>
<section id="version-control---local" class="level1">
<h1>2) Version control - local</h1>
<p>Now, open Rstudio, and create a new project.</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-12-setting-up-a-clean-project-the-best-practice-i-use/images/newprojectr.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Next, click on version control with git:</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-12-setting-up-a-clean-project-the-best-practice-i-use/images/CleanShot 2021-05-12 at 15.09.48@2x.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Fill out the details and open in new session:</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-12-setting-up-a-clean-project-the-best-practice-i-use/images/CleanShot 2021-05-12 at 15.11.41@2x.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>If you don’t want to use github or a similar hub or lab for doing version control, I would at least do it locally. In that case you choose “New Directory” (recommended) or “Existing Directory” (not recommended) for making the folder with its <code>Rproj</code> file.</p>
</section>
<section id="add-the-folder-structure" class="level1">
<h1>3) Add the folder structure</h1>
<p>Now you have something like this (I turned on the normally invisible dotfiles like .gitignore so you can see their presence):</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-05-12-setting-up-a-clean-project-the-best-practice-i-use/images/CleanShot 2021-05-12 at 15.12.59@2x.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Quite barren, isn’t it. <strong>Now comes the trick to avoid having to manually make new folders.</strong></p>
<p>Click on <code>ABB.Rproj</code> (or whatever you named your project folder, followed by <code>.Rproj</code>). This will open up Rstudio. Make a new script or Rmarkdown file and run the following code:</p>
<pre><code>library(here)
library(fs)

dir_create(here("data", "raw"))        # raw data
dir_create(here("data", "processed"))  # intermediate data
dir_create(here(c("scripts",           # storing all .R, .Rmd, .py files
                  "figures",           # output figures
                  "output",            # output files
                  "previous",          # previous versions keep for record
                  "paper",             # current versions of the document
                  "notes",             # random notes
                  "documents"          # supporting documents
                  )
                )
           )</code></pre>
<p>Voilà, the structure has been generated in the right way.</p>
</section>
<section id="thoughts-on-here-and-fs" class="level1">
<h1>Thoughts on <code>here</code> and <code>fs</code></h1>
<p>I cannot stress how important the anchor of Rproj files has been to my workflow, whether or not I actually run code for a particular project. In the not so distant past, R code usually would start with lines like the following to make sure you’re in the right working directory (<code>getwd()</code> and <code>setwd()</code>).</p>
<pre><code># mac
setwd("C:/Thomas/dropbox/here/is/my/unique/folder")
# windows
setwd("C:\\Thomas\\dropbox\\here\\is\\my\\unique\\folder")

rm (list=ls())</code></pre>
<p>Luckily, we were warned not to do so by Jenny Bryan.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*fmEQAQ7H_cqAzwOPCIhv8w.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>And even <em>luckierly</em>, we can just make sure there is an <code>Rproj</code> file in our project folder, and then use the <code>here</code> <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/here_here">package</a> to have a transportable folder that will work both on Windows and Mac (and I guess Linux?) to navigate the structure of folders and files.</p>
<p>The <code>fs</code> <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/fs">package</a> is a better version for managing paths and directories than Base R. The first function (in combination with <code>here</code>) that I find myself using a lot is:</p>
<pre><code>datalist &lt;- fs::dir_ls(here("data", "subfolder_with_lots_of_files"),
                       regexp = ".csv$",
                       recurse = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>This will get you a vector of all .csv files you want to loop over, and it is easy to write and to remember.</p>
<p>The second function that I like helped me draw the diagram of the folder structure given above:</p>
<pre><code>dir_tree(here())</code></pre>
<p>Yes, it was that simple to make that figure.</p>
<p>Anyways, future me and other readers for who this is helpful, now I have a place to come copy the code chunk for generating the project setup and also a record of my current best practice of starting a project. More posts to follow!</p>

<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2021-02-26-et-in-arcadia-ego/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I’m writing this post from my compulsory quarantine hotel in Hong Kong, where I started my postdoctoral fellowship this month. However, by being secluded from the outside–I literally cannot open the window and take a breath of fresh air, luckily the air conditioning system is working optimally–has made me realize how much I have missed just being in Belgium at home during my PhD in Taiwan. Here are some moments that have stood out for me.</p>
<section id="meeting-friends" class="level1">
<h1>Meeting friends</h1>
<p>Due to the ongoing pandemic, and Belgium’s less than optimal situation, I only managed to see perhaps a tenth of the people I was looking forward to meet. Luckily, I did get to meet the ones I met, and I want other people to know that I did yearn for meeting up with them, but unfortunately the situation become worse over time, resulting in nasty measures like the closing of restaurants and bars, museums, or almost anything really.</p>
<p>The first friend I met up with was Cedric, who took me to the “city” where we went to high school together.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50965564547/in/album-72157718439512431/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50965564547_559ed68727_c.jpg" width="800" height="599" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The next time I saw him, he brought my dear old classmate and his dear old twin brother Ruben, who were just stopping by for a socially distanced hi.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50965564757/in/album-72157718439512431/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50965564757_08d9bea228_c.jpg" width="800" height="621" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Later on I would visit Cedric in Brussels, where we went to the museums (after they opened again in January!). It was also an opportunity to use the free train tickets that Belgium government made the national railway company give to each citizen that wanted one. Of course, Belgium’s gonna Belge, and the railway company made it so that you had 12 free trips (hooray!), but divided over six months with two trips per month, basically reducing the value of such a gift to nothing. Still, it took me to Brussels, the capital. This is Cedric and me on the Grand Place, not far from Manneken Pis, which was too small to take a good picture of. Also, please don’t mind the coronacoupe hairstyle. It was all the rage.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50964795403/in/album-72157718439512431/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50964795403_e692c8475e_c.jpg" width="800" height="769" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>One of the most fun activities I did back home was playing boardgames. Here’s one of Cedric losing to me because I put the word “verzande” (e.g., <em>verzande bedding</em>) for a score of 96 points. And all of this because he wouldn’t let me play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya">quenya</a>. Little bean comes for his little wage.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50965503316/in/album-72157718439512431/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50965503316_116508075d_c.jpg" width="800" height="769" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>But spite aside, I had such a great time. So great that in my last days I took yet another railway company-sponsored trip to Ghent, to visit Cedric and Isabelle. Here is us at the fortress that occupies the middle of the city.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50965616577/in/album-72157718439512431/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50965616577_47738da8c1_c.jpg" width="800" height="660" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I mentioned Ruben before, and that brings me to when the twins visited me in our little village, and we could enter the little chapel! Lucky us. Here’s camerashy yet expert photographer Ruben’s picture of the inside of the chapel.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50965478291/in/album-72157718439512431/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50965478291_942a3b132b_c.jpg" width="673" height="800" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>But I did meet up with Ruben once more as well, together with another friend of ours, Margaux, whose wedding was so beautiful a few trips to Belgium ago. This is a covidproof picture of Margaux and her sister (Margaux is also my dentist).</p>

<p>I have some fond memories of the Kalmthoutse Heath. For instance, one time we did a sponsored 10K trek for charity when I was in primary school. But that was a spring time (don’t go there in summer; the heath tends to be ablaze then); now is winter. There was a solemn beauty emanating from the seemingly endless stretches of grassy patches. Very beautiful.</p>

<p>One of the other first groups I got to see where my classmates from Sinology, way back when by now. We went to our favorite local restaurant in Leuven, De Werf (the construction site), where we reminisced about the good old student times and also talked about what everybody had been up to. Well, I guess, it was mostly me who wanted to know because being away for so long made me lose touch to some degree. Here’s a covidian photograph.</p>

<p>And because Mandy couldn’t join us, I decided to become her cuddle contact (knuffelcontact) and visited her little family in their new home. If you visit Mandy, you never go home hungry, nor angry. Not even hangry. Here’s a picture of us in the first 5% of their long garden.</p>

<h1>Meeting with family</h1>
<p>Of course I got to see some family members – yet not as many as I had wanted (My family is actually kind of large, like, at least 13 cousins +- 2). Anyway, here is the “small side” of the family. Picture taken with social distancing rules in mind.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50965618042/in/album-72157718439512431/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50965618042_a4a1afacdc_c.jpg" width="800" height="599" alt="Untitled"></a>

<p>I also got to hang out with my dad quite a few times. For instance, here we went to the Schorre, where every year (well I guess not in 2020 and probably neither in 2021) they do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland">Tomorrowland</a>. I guess people will just have to turn on youtube and watch their own computer play songs. The site, however, was kinda magical. They put up these giants on the domain. Here is a picture of me pointing at a giant who is pointing at the stars. That day became a bit of an <em>ad astra per aspera</em> because I tripped and my foot hurt for a few weeks after.</p>

<p>That last picture was also taken on the same site, but it looks completely different right?! There was a watchtower whence one could observe the Atomium, the Belgian equivalent of the Eiffel tower. My dad says he frequently rides his mountainbike from this ledge.</p>
<p>Of course, most time I spent at home with my mom. And because it became a kind of everyday comfort, I don’t have that many pictures. But I thoroughly enjoyed the TV shows we binged together, the meals we shared and the daily routine I found myself in. Except for vacuuming. But on the other hand, my mom became a proish barrista, whipping up lattes left and right.</p>

<section id="a-reappraisal-of-my-hometown" class="level1">
<h1>A reappraisal of my hometown</h1>
<p>There is something powerful in the notion of being home, but often this sentiment only emerges when you’re away from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/RBumgq5yVrA">Just like so many other things, the feelings attached to it are only noticed in its absence</a>. Musically it has inspired <a href="https://youtu.be/tPxe4WMNus0">one of my favorite albums</a> and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70eYjI4CQQ">a song I like to perform</a> in the confined space of a Taiwanese karaoke room.</p>
<p>Nostalgic intro aside, the ongoing pandemic made it hard for me to do a lot of things apart from taking daily walks with my dog. But they were good opportunities for rediscovering the countryside of Loenhout. Because my self-imposed sabbatical basically was planned for 4 months but was made longer due to certain factors I got to stay 5 months, and see how my home transformed from summer to autumn to winter.</p>
<p>From the castle of Loenhout (btw I have a friend who owns a carpet that came from that castle!), to a first breezy walk, to a walk between the flower fields. A pity they weren’t used in the yearly flower parade.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most fun things was being able to (wow that is some serious academic sentential elongating) (re)discover nice roads to walk on. Like the sports fields – supposedly on a larger terrain than the training field of Real Madrid.</p>

<p>I got to experience the quiet of the countryside at night (okay there was a curfew which helped) and went to places to actually find some stillness, such as the alley behind a local school, full moons through bare trees, a circular graveyard for nuns, and the place where my grandfather’s ashes were enterred last year.</p>

<h1>Matome</h1>
<p><em>Matome</em> is Japanese for ‘conclusion’. Somehow it feels fitting. I am thankful for the period, longer than anticipated, that I could spend at home. It gave me some much needed time to just be and only do light work after the stress of finishing my dissertation. I appreciate the thought of being home even more and knew that I needed to say goodbye yet again. But this time I would be taking a much deeper part of it with me, a somewhat unexpected side effect of covid and being forced to turn inwards.</p>
<p>The final pictures are of my (ex?-)municipal center, het Gemeentehuis van Wuustwezel, also in a former castle, has become a vestige for my time spent growing up and leaving the nest.</p>

<p>My future work will soon involve a more <strong>gestural analysis of ideophones across languages</strong>. I’m slowly plowing through the literature on gesture, but also came across a <a href="https://twitter.com/greg_woodin/status/1316421726948020226?s=20">tweet by Greg Woodin</a>, a PhD student who is investigating gestural metaphors, and who recently installed OpenPose on his computer. <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose">OpenPose</a> is a piece of open-source software that represents the first real-time multi-person system to jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints (in total 135 keypoints) on single images.</p>
<p>Let’s first have a look what it can do:</p>

  <title>CHIDEOD, the Chinese Ideophone Database</title>

  <link>https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2020-11-19-chideod-the-chinese-ideophone-database/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Finally, the paper I wrote together with Arthur Lewis Thompson on the Chinese Ideophone Database is out! Get your copy now at <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/clao/49/2/article-p136_2.xml"><em>Cahiers de Linguistique Asie Orientale</em></a> (or by contacting us).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Van Hoey, Thomas &amp; Arthur Lewis Thompson. 2020. The Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD). <em>Cahiers de linguistique Asie orientale</em> 49(2). 136–167. https://doi.org/10.1163/19606028-bja10006.</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="what-is-chideod" class="level1">
<h1>What is CHIDEOD?</h1>
<p>Creatively abbreviated as CHIDEOD, the Chinese Ideophone Database aims to collect ideophone types (as opposed to tokens — it’s not a corpus!) as found in dedicated studies and dictionaries.</p>
<p>From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This article introduces the Chinese Ideophone Database (chideod), an open-source dataset, which collects 4948 unique onomatopoeia and ideophones (mimetics, expres- sives) of Mandarin, as well as Middle Chinese and Old Chinese. These are analyzed according to a wide range of variables, e.g., description, frequency. Apart from an overview of these variables, we provide a tutorial that shows how the database can be accessed in different formats (.rds, .xlsx, .csv, R package and online app interface), and how the database can be used to explore skewed tonal distribution across Mandarin ideophones. Since chideod is a data repository, potential future research applications are discussed.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="what-is-it-good-for" class="level1">
<h1>What is it good for?</h1>
<p>It is our aim that this database can help us to better delineate and understand Chinese ideophones. With a cross-linguistic definition of “marked words that depict sensory imagery and which belong to an open lexical class” <a href="https://doi.org/10.1075/ill.16.02din">(Dingemanse 2019)</a> we can investigate how and to what exant types recorded in this database map onto that necessarily vague and encompassing definition.</p>
<p>In my <a href="../../files/DISSERTATION.pdf">dissertation</a>, I have a chapter that does exactly this. By exploring different parameters (morphological template, orthograpic reduplication, sensory imagery) one can already sketch a more detailed picture of what “the Chinese ideophonic lexicon” looks like.</p>
<p>But there’s more. CHIDEOD contains a number of psycholinguistically informative variables on the characters that make up Chinese ideophones, taken from the amazing Chinese Lexical Database <a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1038-3">(Sun et al.&nbsp;2018)</a>, which can help one design experiments.</p>
<p>Then there’s also the corpus component: the complete list of ideophone types or a subset thereof can be run on a corpus to extract sentences / utterances containing ideophones. A straightforward usage is investigating the interplay between ideophones and constructions <a href="../../files/DISSERTATION.pdf">(see my dissertation)</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, for typological questions this database is quite useful. We incorporated reconstructed pronuncations of items (based on the <a href="http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/">Baxter-Sagart system</a>), which can be compared to other ideophonic forms in the region, or inform us about sound symbolism (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1215/23290048-3324236">Smith 2015</a> for an in-depth but limited case study of sound symbolism in the <em>Shījīng</em>).</p>
</section>
<section id="what-chideod-doesnt-do" class="level1">
<h1>What CHIDEOD doesn’t do</h1>
<p>It’s a misconception that CHIDEOD is a corpus. As such, it does not contain any KWIC (keyword in context) information, or token frequencies; because if you’re interested in that, all you have to do is plug the list into a corpus to extract that information.</p>
<p>As of yet, there is no multimodal data involved, like pictures of videoclips, like there is for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jpmimeticthesaurus/"><em>Multimedia Encyclopedia of Japanese Mimetics (MEJaM)</em></a> or the <a href="http://nongrat.us/quechua/"><em>Quechua realwords</em></a>.</p>
<p>And on a third note, perhaps somewhat weirdly, it does not contain information about the “ideophonicity” or “iconicness” of these items, simply because that information is not out there yet (if you have this data and want us to incorporate it, please get in touch). There is also some debate going on about the validity of such ratings at the moment as well, so I am kind of holding off at the moment though.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-can-i-get-chideod" class="level1">
<h1>Where can I get CHIDEOD?</h1>
<p>This is perhaps what I’m most proud of. We’ve built a database that is freely accessible and can be used for non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p>You can find the OSF repository of CHIDEOD <a href="https://osf.io/kpwgf/">here</a> and its accompanying github repository <a href="https://github.com/simazhi/chinese_ideophone_database">here</a>.</p>
<p>The OSF repository contains versioned updates on the database, which can be obtained in .rds, .csv, and .xlsx.</p>
<p>But there is also the <a href="https://simazhi.shinyapps.io/chideod_appversion/">app version</a>, which lets you select the variables you’re interested in and export them to the clipboard, CSV or Excel.</p>
<p>Then, for the R-minded interested parties, you can also get it in an R package by running the following command:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">library</span>(devtools)</span>
<span id="cb1-2">devtools<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;

font-style: inherit;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"simazhi/chinese_ideophone_database/CHIDEOD"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="final-tips-and-tricks" class="level1">
<h1>Final tips and tricks</h1>
<p>When using the database in code, it is recommended to run a command like <code>dplyr::distinct()</code> or <code>unique()</code> on subsets, as the data is stored in a reasonably tidy way, which means many values get repeated once you start subsetting.</p>
<p>Also we recommend keeping <code>traditional</code> or <code>simplified</code> in the mix when you start subsetting, so as to avoid erroneously taking homophones for the same word.</p>
<p>Lastly, we advise that you read the companion article in <em>CLAO</em> thoroughly.</p>
</section>
<section id="got-questions" class="level1">
<h1>Got questions?</h1>
<p>If you are interested in using this database but are unsure of how or what can mean for you in your research, do not hesitate to get in touch, we will try to help you to the best of our abilities.</p>
<p>If you spot an error (<em>errare humanum est</em>), be sure to let us know as well; we will try to fix it in a next update.</p>
<p>If you have data that is compatible with this database, or want tips and tricks for making your own database like this, I also welcome you.</p>

  <title>How I organize my notes</title>
  <dc:creator>Thomas Van Hoey</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2020-10-18-how-i-organize-my-notes/obsidianheader.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>One of the basic skills people, but PhD students and academics in particular, need to cultivate is sharpening their research workflow. You need to cultivate this by just doing it, but also by reviewing it from time to time. In this update, I’ll talk about a new app that has entered my life and made note-taking better: <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (not a paid sponsorship, just me sharing my thoughts).</p>
<section id="general-note-structure" class="level1">
<h1>General note structure</h1>
<p>I’ve written about this research workflow before (<a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/icons-we-live-by/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/handling-research/">here</a>). In the second post I outlined a method for taking notes and basically still use it to this day:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make sure Zotero has the right entry.</li>
<li>Export a bibliography (Unified Linguistics Stylesheet FTW~~)</li>
<li>Open a note in the note-taking app.</li>
<li>Make an entry that looks like this in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">markdown</a></li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<pre><code>SHORT REFERENCE (exported from Zotero but shortened)

FULL REFERENCE (exported from Zotero, just to be sure you get the full reference)

Read: YYYYMMDD

GENERAL OBSERVATION (good / bad paper, useful...)

SUMMARY OF THE PAPER
QUOTES
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO TAKE FROM THIS PAPER FOR THE FUTURE YOU</code></pre>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXkT2tewLlQ">quite a few people</a> that will tell you how to take notes content-wise, but I’m here to tell you about my system. The way people take notes is highly individualized, especially in terms of what you actually jot down, and it often really depends on the paper. If it’s a very graphical paper then I would like to add a lot of screenshots or other figures; if it’s just a “<a href="https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/SALT/article/view/26.664/3665">oh yeah this exists</a>” paper, then that is what I note and move on with my life.</p>
</section>
<section id="but-what-software" class="level1">
<h1>But what software?</h1>
<p>Software-wise, I still don’t think it’s a good idea to keep all your notes in MS Word, but instead look for a way to ensure the longevity of your notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hpAJMSS8pvs">This video</a> by Nicholas Cifuentes-Goodbody was very influential for me many years ago and I urge you to watch it if you are still stuck waiting for Word to open. Also <a href="https://www.anghyflawn.net/teaching/2015/ilw-pandoc/">the slogan in this blog</a>: “Your academic life in plain text”, or <a href="https://www.simondcoll.com/markdown-students-academics/">this informative blog</a>. If this video and blog appeal to you, you may want to invest in learning markdown. I think <a href="https://youtu.be/EUoCW-dvnoY">at most it will take you 20 minutes that will change your life, as advertised here</a>.</p>
<p>But what do you write markdown in? Like many students of my generation, I started with <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, the elephant that promised to help us remember everything. I still think Evernote is a pretty good app for general grabbing and storing, because it has adapted for everything. However, their unwillingness to make a simple native (read: free) markdown editor for a thousand years or so (okay the past five years) has made many people jump the ship, and so did I.</p>
<p>In 2018 (I think) I came across an app called <a href="https://notable.app/">Notable</a>, the brainchild of 1 person, which had the catchy slogan of being “the markdown-based note-taking app that doesn’t suck”. Basically, it was shown that having markdown (.md) files locally on your computer, which you can keep in the cloud, is a fast and reliable way of taking notes, because you’re not locked into an ecosystem (like Evernote but also lots of popular productivity apps). I became convinced that this is what I needed and I am happy I moved away from Evernote to Notable. Somewhat in awe I watched every update over the past few years, like the integration of figures, split editor, etc.</p>
<p>But while the progress of Fabio is admirable and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Notable/">the reddit community</a> is great, I was enticed twice recently to make another switch.</p>
<p>The first enticement was <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> but after seeing its exorbitant prices for an extremely new app (165 dollars per year, yuck), I was looking for an alternative and found <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (free for personal use), which is backed by a team of highly motivated people that were either “inspired” by Notable or in a case of convergent evolution developed the same idea that notes should be kept on your own system.</p>
<p>But where it really shines is the <a href="https://youtu.be/SyV4xez9Lp0">backlinking and network visualization of notes</a>, a feature that Roam also excels at and <em>can</em> be implemented in Notable (but is not super well-supported), and I guess it was enough to take the jump and try Obsidian out.</p>
</section>
<section id="migrating-from-notable-to-obsidian-with-r" class="level1">
<h1>Migrating from Notable to Obsidian with R</h1>
<p>As always, I started with an Rproject, so I can sync it to github (private folder though ✌️). In that folder, I have a subfolder ‘academic_notes’ with all the notes and a subfolder ‘attachments’ for all the figures. Next, I just copied everything from my local Notable folder to the new academic_notes folder.</p>
<p>The hardest part was writing a small R-script to change all <code>![](@attachment/NAME)</code> from Notable to the form <code>![[NAME]]</code>, so that all figures could be rendered in Obsidian.</p>
</section>
<section id="structuring-my-notes" class="level1">
<h1>Structuring my notes</h1>
<p>Just to give you an impression, I have some 700 notes with details as outlined above. This does not represent everything I have ever read, but a good chunk of it. However, in Notable, I just had a flat structure, like this one:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2020-10-18-how-i-organize-my-notes/images/flat_structure.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>flat structure</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Wow, what a clusterfuck. If we zoom out we can see that every note is represented by a dot. Using the handy backlinking system <code>[[TERM YOU WANT TO TAG]]</code> with the square brackets, you can start linking notes together.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2020-10-18-how-i-organize-my-notes/images/first_structure.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>first structure</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I had quite a bit of fun with manually going through my notes, checking for links and adding unlinked data to the network:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://thomasvanhoey.com/posts/2020-10-18-how-i-organize-my-notes/images/adding_manual_links.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>adding manual links</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>But then I suddenly saw the R-light! I thought, let’s do this programmatically and thematically. So I wrote a dirty script to read in every file and add the double square brackets for every term that I wanted.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to link all words that have “ideophone” together, this is what I wrote:</p>
<pre><code>library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
library(fs)
library(here)



files &lt;- dir_ls(here("academic_notes"),
                regexp = ".md$")

add_backlink &lt;- function(file){
  filepad &lt;- file
  
  target &lt;- glue("(?&lt;!\\[)\\b{word}s?\\b(?!\\])")
  vervanging &lt;- glue("[[{word}]]")

  read_lines(file) %&gt;% 
      str_replace_all(target, vervanging) %&gt;%
    write_lines(filepad)
}





######################
# change this variable
word &lt;- "ideophone"
######################

walk(files, add_backlink) # actually running things</code></pre>
<p>Ask me about it if you are interested lol. And if you keep the graph open you can see it changing in real time, which is very satisfying.</p>

</section>
<section id="a-network-of-notes" class="level1">
<h1>A network of notes</h1>
<p>And then finally, we get a better representation of the notes that intersect in certain topics. I believe this can help me to write better surveys of the literature. But for now it’s mostly pretty to look at. Good luck trying this out and <strong>if you have a different workflow, I’d happily learn about it!</strong></p>

  <title>Summertime sadness. See you Taiwan!</title>
  <dc:creator>Thomas Van Hoey</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Wow! It has already been one month (to the day) since my Taiwan adventure ended and I came back to Belgium. High time I publish the third installment of my graduation blogs (<a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/hashtag-dissertating/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/defense-dark-art/">part 2</a>).</p>
<section id="so-when-are-you-graduating" class="level1">
<h1>“So when are you graduating?”</h1>
<p>One of the questions that PhD students do not like hearing is “so when are you graduating?”. In many programs, there might be a fixed duration, but the actual date of finishing stays unclear until the end. This often has to do with the progress of a PhD candidate within a program or the relation with the supervisor, but it can also be hard to answer due to unclear milestones that succeed one another rapidly near the end.</p>
<p>For me, I knew I hadn’t graduated when I delivered my intellectual baby (see <a href="https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/defense-dark-art/">part 2</a>). The next milestone, the PhD defense, feels much more like an initiation ritual: you’re being asked questions about your research and essentially get the stamp of approval from your committee. And if all goes well and you pass, you become the newest member of PhD holders. But you still haven’t graduated. There is the official graduation ceremony–of which I am so glad that it could still happen in-person in this COVID-laden year in Taiwan– and yes that is also a milestone.</p>
<p>However, by then I still didn’t have my degree. So had I actually graduated? I kept asking myself this somewhat existential question from time to time during this year’s summer. This also had to do with the revisions that were needed for my dissertation.</p>
<p>As a quick note, it is very customary for PhD dissertations to pass with amazing grades and still need to undergo some revisions, ranging from minor things to major revisions or even being failed. Luckily mine did pass with pretty great grades (A+) but I still was asked to rework some parts substantially, which i happily did. As I have often heard</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The only good dissertation is a finished dissertation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deadline of submitting this revised version (which should pass along your advisor) was 20 August 2020. And actually it’s earlier, as you also need to get your uploaded version accepted by a team of librarians, who probably are swamped with work around this deadline. My first submission into the system, which I had spent a few hours getting the right formatting for, came back a day later with notes for issues that they had not clearly outlined in their instructions. So I spent a few hours making the necessary changes and clicked submit again, hoping for the best. Yes, the second time it did go through and I could print–yet another source of potential stress within a week of the looming deadline. Luckily, the lady from the print shop was extremely friendly and professional, and within just a few hours (!!!! Belgium take note !!!!) I had my copies to submit to the library and the department–yet another milestone that is part of graduating (which I completed on the 20th of August). I should also make the side note that I had to provide 1 copy for NTU library, one for my department, and one for the National Library. Yes, you can check out my dissertation in the National Library of Taiwan. Here is a picture of the 20th of August, when I ran into my friend Amirah who incicentally went to submit her dissertation as well.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50364494686/in/album-72157716358267992/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50364494686_b99da0af9b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>It was just a bit before this time that I heard that there is actually a checklist of stuff you need to do to leave school (離校), available in the online administration system. And this involved lots of trips around different offices. For instance, to leave my dorm, I needed three signatures and a trip to the office of student housing; for leaving Taiwan, I needed to let the office of international affairs know that I could be scrapped from the national insurance program (very good medical insurance program though!)… And so I rediscovered the campus I had spent five years, going from <em>hot</em> to <em>her</em>. A complication about this list in my case was that I could only finish the list at the end of August, because I was still under contract as a research assistant.</p>
<p>So the 28th I finally finished the checklist, went to yet another office, and FINALLY GOT MY DEGREE! My student card was stamped as invalid (this is a good thing) and I also was able to get my alumni card. Here is a picture of my invalidated student ID and my alumni card, both with an extremely old picture–nobody had told me during my application that the picture I sent in would be used for this purpose 🤷🏼‍♂️️️.</p>
<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50364631882/in/album-72157716358267992/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50364631882_6d783518e3_4k.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="800" height="600"></a></p>
<p>So, in conclusion, I think that the question of when you actually graduate a PhD program is manifestly multifold. For me personally, I felt most graduated (yes graduating is a feeling) in the aftermath of my defense, when I attended the ceremony, when I went to submit my dissertation to the library and when I got my actual degree. But the most nerve-wrecking is definitely the first of these.</p>
<p>Now, in the last weeks of my time in Taiwan, I also decided to print a more luxurious version of my thesis, with the older official formatting. I’m talking black hardcover and golden letters. Below you can see the four stages my pie of research went through: the Proposal version, the Defense version, the Library version and finally the Memorial version.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50363759553/in/album-72157716358267992/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50363759553_4fec8a6fe5_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Untitled"></a>
<script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>This fancy version I had printed 10 times, all about 600 NTD, so that means the price was extremely reasonable for an eventually 520 or so page-long document. Five were for my advisor and other committee members, 1 was for myself, and 4 were for interested parties that helped me a lot during my studies. Here is me handing it over to my advisor. I am grateful to Dr.&nbsp;Chiarung Lu for taking me on and the academic freedom in these years, and also all the advice she gave to me. 謝謝老師.</p>

<h1>Summertime sadness</h1>
<p>While these somewhat stressful events were playing out, I of course was also realizing that the end of Taiwan time was drawing near–an experience that must be similar to that of the Elves in Lord of the Rings, who are fading away into the West. That being said, I had a great summer, spending lots of time with CJ and going places, like Taichung or restaurants and cafés we loved going.</p>

This also meant lots of saying goodbye to people, like the other alumni of my department.</p>

<p>I also needed to leave my dorm–that place with the amazing view that I might never get again. Discarding of most of my stuff, either to the other dorm people or by throwing it away, and storing some books at CJ’s place made my room suddenly feel so empty. I remember in the last moments of my last days, I went to the rooftop and sat with myself, taking this radical change in. By moving out, I really was saying goodbye to a part of myself: Thomas the PhD student. Here is a picture of me letting that thought get to me.</p>

<h1>The Last Day</h1>
<p>After CJ also had left (back to the USA for his PhD), I stayed a few days in a hotel, while trying to wrap up what needed wrapping up, mostly administrative stuff. On my penultimate day, I had a job interview (more about that soo). On my last day, I checked out and tried to use the city check-in. Unfortunately, due to COVID and a stupid rule concerning my trekking backpack, I couldn’t do it in the city, but actually had to travel all the way to Sanchong to drop my stuff off. They weighed my luggage, which of course was too heavy, so they had me transfer a number of books into my carry-on luggage. After losing way too much time, I had a hair appointment. That also ran out and I was also late for my next appointment: a lunch date with my advisor and student-colleague Adrw. I had a wonderful time and got a goodbye gift – Taiwanese facemasks and a Japanese handkerchief, which I really appreciate.</p>

<p>After my hectic day so far, I had a few hours in the eye of the storm. That meant I needed to go back to school and make sure my desk was empty. In the evening I had a great last dinner with Iju, who also escorted me to the airport MRT.</p>
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/50364654037/in/album-72157716358267992/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50364654037_ff41b44e6e_c.jpg" width="800" height="599" alt="Untitled"></a>

<p>And when I got to the airport, I knew that I would be taking the same plane as the person who was in charge of the summer school I was into all those years ago, Jungchen. So in a crazy twist of fate, my Taiwan adventure had come full circle.</p>

<p>So yeah, then it was time to say goodbye to Taiwan, and hello to Holland.</p>

<p>And, finally, I was so happy to see my parents again. Home.</p>
