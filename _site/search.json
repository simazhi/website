    "text": "Contact\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nHi, my name is Thomas Van Hoey [’to:mas van ’huy] Alternatively, you may find me by my Chinese name — 司馬智 (Hanyu pinyin: Sīmǎ Zhì).\nI am a senior postdoctoral fellow affiliated with the Research Foundation of Flanders (FWO, Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek) and hosted by the Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics (QLVL) research group in the Department of Linguistics at KU Leuven. My current project “Borrowing iconic words” investigates the purported negative relationship between borrowability and iconicity, in a wide number of languages across the world.\nPreviously, I worked together with Benedikt Szmrecsanyi, also at the same department. The project provided an empirical verification with regard to the idea that increased absolute complexity in language is positively correlated with increased relative complexity. Against typical foundational notions in the field, we found no evidence of this is in a spoken corpus.\nBefore that, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Hong Kong, in the Language and Development Lab, led by Youngah Do. Our main project, together with Mark Dingemanse and Arthur Lewis Thompson, focused on the learnability of ideophones from a cross-linguistic perspective while focusing on the artiuculatory and gesticulatory gestures of the ideophonic items.\nThat project was related to my previous qualifications. By training, I am a sinologist and a linguist, with a PhD in Linguistics (obtained at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics of National Taiwan University). My MA degrees in Sinology and Linguistics were obtained at the KU Leuven.\nIn that work, I have focused on understanding how people construe meaning through ideophones and iconicity, while balancing cognitive and cultural factors. Consequently, my PhD dissertation (2020), “Prototypicality and salience of Chinese ideophones: A cognitive and corpus linguistics approach”, supervised by Lu Chiarung, investigates the Chinese ideophonic lexicon through four different methodological lenses: multiple correspondence analysis, diachronic prototype semantics, semantic vector spaces, and collostructional analysis. A prototypical structuring of the ideophonic lexicon is found throughout the data, which is collected from the corpus as well as the Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD). CHIDEOD is freely accessible online in multiple formats, and can be used as a model for the cross-linguistic database that is to be constructed in the first stage of the project.\nClick here for my academic cv."

    "text": "GRF 2020/2021\n\nPI [Youngah Do](http://ldl.linguistics.hku.hk/)\nCo-I [Mark Dingemanse](https://markdingemanse.net/)\nCo-I Thompson Arthur Lewis\nExecuting Thomas Van Hoey\n\n\nGeneral Research Fund (GRF), University Grants Council (UGC), Hong Kong\nAmount: 700,134 HKD\nNumber: \n\n\nAbstract\nfrom the HKU linguistics website:\nImitation is a core part of learning and expressing language. In order to understand certain words, we must know what makes them imitative. These ‘certain words’ are ideophones. Ideophones exist in all known spoken languages. They are known to be easily understood by non-native speakers due to their imitative nature. Studies show that if, for example, a Dutch speaker hears a Japanese ideophone, even with zero Japanese experience, they can intuit that ideophone’s meaning. This implies that ideophones tap into a universal cognitive ability that gives sound a meaning under the right communicative circumstances.\nThe goal of our research is to investigate how ideophones express meaning in terms of a universally accessible ability for all spoken language users: articulatory movement of speech organs. To date, linguistic research has largely ignored ideophones because most meanings cannot be expressed by imitation, eg, foot, pink, mountain. Ideophones are limited to descriptive meanings like sounds, motions, visuals, touch/feel, and inner feelings, eg, plonk, zig-zag, bling-bling.\nDespite this, parent-child interactions are full of ideophones, so much so that ideophones have been proposed as a crucial component to language learning. Still, we do not know how ideophones are learnt, nor do we know what makes them easily learnable. What we do know is that ideophones frequently co-occur with what is also largely ignored by traditional linguists: descriptive hand gestures. Some researchers claim that ideophones are incomplete without their co-occurring hand gestures, arguing that ideophones are analogous to descriptive gestures made with the mouth instead of the hands.\nGiven that movement is imperative for understanding hand gestures, this project hypothesizes that movement of speech organs is key to learning and understanding ideophones. No study has investigated ideophones in terms of articulatory (speech organ) movement or co-speech hand gesture. The current project seeks to close this gap by being the first to empirically incorporate movement and hand gesture as factors into two ideophone learning studies.\nOur first study investigates whether articulatory complexity affects how well non-native speakers learn ideophones without gestures, following a well-established ideophone learning paradigm. Our second study investigates how participants use hand gestures to teach and learn ideophones of varying articulatory complexity in an iterated learning task, a pioneering study for ideophones.\nCumulatively, our project will lead to a deeper understanding of how audio-visual movement can improve language learning and instruction, allowing for impact beyond the realm of research and into the classroom.\n\n\nMy role in the project\n\n\nOutputs and blog posts"

    "text": "A long anticipated update of my blog. The last update was published almost a month ago. This time you are in for a treat (and a very long post, the way you like it!)\nThoughtful readers will notice that a major change has taken place - this post is written in English. (There is a minor change as well in the way I upload pictures - but it is in a test phase.)\nWhy is that? As I feel most of my Belgian audience as well as most of my more international audience (those few people around the world who stumble upon my blog) are proficient in English, it would be ‘unfair’ to exclude the latter from my adventures, should they have any interest into the matter. I hope you, the reader, will agree that this is a good direction for this blog - if so, or if not, you are always welcome to share your thoughts in the comment section below. I am not talking to you spammer guys.\nSo, without further ado, let us get on with the show. The title of this blog is called Pride & Ride. This refers to the two main parts of this piece of writing - the Gay Pride Parade in Taiwan and my bike ride with friends to Fulong.\n\nGay pride\n\n\n\nNO AGE LIMIT\n\n\nOn the 31st of October 2015 Taiwan held its 13th LGBT Pride Parade (_Taiwan tongzhi youxing _台灣同志遊行). The theme of this parade was “NO AGE LIMIT” (nianling bu shexian 年齡不設限). I had actually never attended a parade before - of any kind, so I was quite excited to see if flooding the streets en masse really provides a sense of mutual connectedness.This event is huge in Taiwan - sometimes described as the ‘Gay capital of the Far East’. I do not know whether this is true, but I can tell there were a lot of people (around 80 000) interested in the event. So much that there were two lines for walking.\nWe - because I went with friends - followed the red line. Since it was also Halloween on the same day, there were not only the typical gay pride outfits the (Belgian) news tends to cover, but also some funny scary outfits. My favourite was seeing Wednesday from the Addams family. \nAnother major dress up team seems to be animal based. This is not surprising, given the idea of the ‘Gay zoo’, which most prominently harbours bears, but also other ‘animals’. As for ‘companions’, dog(e)s seem to do very well.\n\n\n\nDoge\n\n\nAnd to extend it even further, we even got a Pokémon mascotte that is probably familiar to all readers - Pikachu. That yellow skin, those brown and black markings, those red cheeks, that electric current; everybody’s favourite pokémon has got it all. ピカピカ！\n \nAll in all, it was a great event. I was happy to see some of my old friends back - maybe it was some sort of serendipity or just coincidental, but at the time I was really glad. You can check all of my pictures if you click on one of the highlighted ones, or on the album that marks the end of the first part of this blog. They are worth looking at.\n\n\n\nPower rangers\n\n\n\n\nBike ride\nOne week later, we - that is my Chinese friend Wang Hao 王浩, my French friend Léo and me - went to Fulong 福隆 beach to have a nice bicycle ride next to the beach. Unfortunately, we took the wrong way. So instead of seeing the tourist hotspots we saw empty views. The tourist hotspots supposedly include the Old Caoling Tunnel (_Jiu Caoling suidao _舊草嶺隧道), a 2 km train tunnel built in 1924 through which you can bike and numerous of biking routes - like the one we took, but in the wrong direction. However, we still got some nice views.\n  \nBy driving in the wrong direction on our rental bikes, we eventually got to a deserted ‘beach’ (if you could call it that), where we ate our special Fulong lunch boxes. Me and the French guy were pretty happy to find a private beach, but Wang Hao seemed unhappy as it is not where you have to go when visiting. I think this is perhaps a cultural difference - I tend to go to the places that ‘are undiscovered’ or at least less crowded, while Chinese seem to go to the hotspots, take some pictures and leave. While we were in China (cf. virtually the whole of my blog up until now) this also seemed commonplace.\n\n\n\nPrivate beach\n\n\nNow, on the way back home we had an unfortunate encounter with some really rude people. As it was the first time I experienced real rudeness since I came to Taiwan, I was a bit shocked. The situation was as follows: we were on the slow train - meaning you can use your easycard for public transport to take it, because the train is shaped like a metro carriage. This implies that there is free seating, as long as you can find it. We crossed the train until we arrived in the final carriage and sure enough, we spotted some seats at the tail of the train. Unfortunately, and I was not aware of this, bicycles are human enough to fit into one of Fillmore’s Frame Semantic theory that includes frames for the lexeme ‘sit’, such as Change_posture and Posture, both of which require a sentient protagonist - in normal words: a human or an animal, but definitely not a bike. I friendly asked the people of the ‘fat people go biking for a day and take up all the space in the train’ biking club if we maybe could move their bicycles in order to sit down. All I got for a reply was an angry stare and the words: “But we already put them there”. I will share with you my questionable looking face that I also posted on facebook.  \n\n\n\nMy bike is a person\n\n\nSpeaking of facebook, there were a lot of people who supported my frustration (almost 70), but some people commented that there are rude people everywhere around the globe and to think otherwise is a fallacy. I guess that commenter is right, but it still is not nice when it happens. And the worst part is that I did not know if I was ‘allowed’ as a foreigner to continue the debate with these thick people or I should let it go. My nature seems to be to want to fight, but I saw in my companions’ eyes that they did not want to fight for their seat, so I backed down as well. I was thinking back to a line i our guidebooks we got in the third year of high school, when we went on a class trip to London. It read:\n\nProvoceer geen marginalen! (Do not provoke marginalised people!)\n\nAnd it is one of the tenets that I use to find my way in life.\n\n\nOther updates\nOther important updates that I want to share with you are the bike ride around the neigbourhood. More specifically, I went bike riding in the water park near my dorm, next to the Xindian creek (Xindian xi 新店溪) and around my campus.\nFurthermore, we also went to sing karaoke, one of my favourite hobbies.\n\n\n\nIMG_20151116_004337\n\n\nOne of my favourite professor at the University of Leuven retired. Em. prof. dr. Willy Vande Walle was my thesis advisor when I was doing my MA in Sinology. I was a bit sad that I could not attend the celebration. However, I saw a call for videos or messages in some form and decided I should also make one of my own. I like to think he was very happy with it, given his comment on the youtube video and the retweet - yes he is a very hip emeritus professor. I cannot begin to state how happy and fortunate I am to have being able to enjoy his lectures. I think he is a scholarly example for all of us, one of the reasons he got an Order of the Rising Sun award from Japan - having founded the Japanology department at the University of Leuven, while being a great Sinologist as well. I am proud to call myself a student of him - which makes us return to the first theme of this article.\n\n\nhttps://t.co/OU9fxuKLlh Deze eufonische toespraak in spiegelschrift van mijn ideofonische wapenbroeder maakt me euforisch.\n\n— willy.vandewalle (@willyvandewalle) October 30, 2015\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, I was interviewed by the University of Leuven’s student newspaper Veto (2015 42:6). Since their archive seems to behave strangely, I will upload a picture of the article here.\n\nAnd that’s all folks!"

13th LGBT Pride Parade (_Taiwan tongzhi youxing _台灣同志遊行). The theme of this parade was \\\"NO AGE LIMIT\\\" (_nianling bu shexian_ 年齡不設限). I had actually never attended a parade before - of any kind, so I was quite excited to see if flooding the streets en masse really provides a sense of mutual connectedness.This event is huge in Taiwan - sometimes described as the 'Gay capital of the Far East'. I do not know whether this is true, but I can tell there were a lot of people (around 80 000) interested in the event. So much that there were two lines for walking.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n[40] \"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n[41] \"We - because I went with friends - followed the red line. Since it was also Halloween on the same day, there were not only the typical gay pride outfits the (Belgian) news tends to cover, but also some funny scary outfits. My favourite was seeing [Wednesday from the Addams family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family).

Unfortunately, we took the wrong way. So instead of seeing the tourist hotspots we saw empty views. The tourist hotspots supposedly include the Old Caoling Tunnel (_Jiu Caoling suidao _舊草嶺隧道), a 2 km train tunnel built in 1924 through which you can bike and numerous of biking routes - like the one we took, but in the wrong direction.

Me and the French guy were pretty happy to find a private beach, but Wang Hao seemed unhappy as it is not where you have to go when visiting. I think this is perhaps a cultural difference - I tend to go to the places that 'are undiscovered' or at least less crowded, while Chinese seem to go to the hotspots, take some pictures and leave. While we were in China (cf. virtually the whole of my blog up until now) this also seemed commonplace.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n[58] \"[![Private beach](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/569/23175706765_34c08b28d5_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/23175706765/in/album-72157661394505216/)Now, on the way back home we had an unfortunate encounter with some really rude people. As it was the first time I experienced real rudeness since I came to Taiwan, I was a bit shocked. The situation was as follows: we were on the slow train - meaning you can use your easycard for public transport to take it, because the train is shaped like a metro carriage. This implies that there is free seating, as long as you can find it. We crossed the train until we arrived in the final carriage and sure enough, we spotted some seats at the tail of the train. Unfortunately, and I was not aware of this, bicycles are human enough to fit into one of [Fillmore's Frame Semantic theory](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/) that includes frames for the lexeme 'sit', such as [Change_posture](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml?frame=Change_posture) and [Posture](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml?frame=Posture), both of which require a sentient protagonist - in normal words: a human or an animal, but definitely not a bike. I friendly asked the people of the 'fat people go biking for a day and take up all the space in the train' biking club if we maybe could move their bicycles in order to sit down. All I got for a reply was an angry stare and the words: \\\"But we already put them there\\\". I will share with you my questionable looking face that I also posted on facebook.   [![My bike is a person](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/771/23149603326_afb7e0e553_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/23149603326/in/album-72157661394505216/)Speaking of facebook, there were a lot of people who supported my frustration (almost 70), but some people commented that there are rude people everywhere around the globe and to think otherwise is a fallacy. I guess that commenter is right, but it still is not nice when it happens. And the worst part is that I did not know if I was 'allowed' as a foreigner to continue the debate with these thick people or I should let it go. My nature seems to be to want to fight, but I saw in my companions' eyes that they did not want to fight for their seat, so I backed down as well. I was thinking back to a line i our guidebooks we got in the third year of high school, when we went on a class trip to London.

professor at the University of Leuven retired. Em. prof. dr. Willy Vande Walle was my thesis advisor when I was doing my MA in Sinology. I was a bit sad that I could not attend the celebration. However, I saw a call for videos or messages in some form and decided I should also make one of my own.  I like to think he was very happy with it, given his comment on the youtube video and the retweet - yes he is a very hip emeritus professor. I cannot begin to state how happy and fortunate I am to have being able to enjoy his lectures. I think he is a scholarly example for all of us, one of the reasons he got an [Order of the Rising Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Rising_Sun) award from Japan - having founded the Japanology department at the University of Leuven, while being a great Sinologist as well. I am proud to call myself a student of him - which makes us return to the first theme of this article. \"

    "text": "Hi!\nIt has been a month since our last meeting - or less if you looked at this blog more recently. In this update I would like to share with you an amazing trip we had to the waterfall of Shifen 十分 at the end of November. Since it is Christmas time, I am planning to give a few more updates in the next week - to wrap things up.\n\nShifen\nOn the 22th November we had arranged a trip to go the waterfall of Shifen 十分瀑布. I say we, but I should actually say the exclusive ‘we’ that refers to Joe, my Dutch friend with Chinese roots. And more inclusively, the ‘we’ refers also to Wang Hao, Merve, Naoto, Roger, Arisa, Justin, Joe and his girlfriend and me.\nSo we took the train to Shifen and first wandered in the old street, snacking on the local dishes, after which we had lunch in a restaurant.\n\n\n\n2015-11-22 12.58.17\n\n\n\n\n\n2015-11-22 12.56.37\n\n\nAfter lunch, we set off to the waterfall. I have always liked the sound of the Chinese word for ‘waterfall’ - pùbù 瀑布. At first I thought there might be some sound symbolism involved there. In Middle Chinese, they are reconstructed as  buwk puH, and in Old Chinese this becomes [b]ˤawk pˤa-s (both are in Baxter & Sagart’s transcription)*. That pu is related to water is very obvious - it means something like ‘a large amount of rain’. However, bu ‘cloth’ may also be related to water if we can believe the Shuowen Jiezi, which mentions that bu is the same as quan 泉 ‘source, spring, fountain’. Anyway, an etymology that gives you ‘a lot of rain/water’ + ‘spring’ makes a nice impression for the concept ‘waterfall’, so it will have to make do. Of course, the alliteration of their reconstructed forms remains interesting and there may be something to it, but nothing can’t be proven unless we find more examples. I will put this in my ‘for future research’ section :) .\nIn any case, it is a nicer etymology than the Germanic languages. English waterfall, Dutch waterval, German _Wasserfall _etc. just give you an explanation à la ‘waterfall, because water fall’. It kind of reminded me of a post I saw on the high-culture website 9gag, where they explained the seasons. British English calls the season after summer ‘autumn’, while Americans supposedly call it ‘fall - because leaf fall’. At the time it was funny, or at least funnier than now when I relate this to you. Anyway, enough etymology, here are some pictures of us at the waterfall - because water fall.\n\n\n\n2015-11-22 15.13.16\n\n\n\n\n\n2015-11-22 15.18.15\n\n\n\n\n\n2015-11-22 15.19.46\n\n\nThen, after sundown (because sun down), as evening fell (because evening fall) we also decided to write on a lantern and put all of our wishes on it, so they can become reality. You have probably seen pictures or footage of this before. There is even a holiday in January where they release the lanterns (in a special place - Pingxi 平溪 ). The lantern was HUGE, so we all got to write multiple wishes and I may already have seen some of them come true. Here is the clip of us releasing the lantern in the sky.\nI will not spill the beans as to what I wrote on the lantern, but if you can read Chinese, you may be able to figure out which one I am. Especially if you are familiar with my roosterlegs. As a final bonus, here are the rest of the pictures. I will see you in a few days for the next update!  \n    *Other transcriptions give similar results:\nLi Fang-Kuei gives: pùbù &lt; MC buk puo &lt; OC bʰog puag\nDong Tongshu gives: pùbù &lt; MC bʰuk puo &lt; OC bagwh pagh"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here we are again - after a few weeks of battling the tasks imposed by finals. My friends had warned me before:\n\n“Whaaaat, you have taken 15 credits (of courses this semester), you will collapse during finals”\n[“waaaaa ni xiule 15 xuefen, ni qimo yiding hui bengkui\n哇～～你修了15學分，你期末一定會崩潰”.]\n\nApart from the very interesting usage of that last word - bengkui ’collapse’,  which seemed to be used for ‘the realm/our land collapses’ (tianxia 天下) or ‘the emperor dies’ (e.g. Wen di 文帝) in the earliest sources and is now applicable to ‘normal people’ - they were right. The pressure was noticeable and I am sure now that 1 study credit here has a higher BMI than one in Leuven, to which I already hinted at in September.\nIn this post, I will tell you all about the scholarship award ceremony, which took place on 18 December 2015. As is often the case, these things are planned to the detail and two and a halve weeks before that date, I received an e-mail, asking me if I was interested in doing a speech in Chinese on behalf of the foreign PhD students who got the same scholarship as I had received.\nIt has a very long name, but I am really glad that I got this opportunity to thank the university and all the people involved in the selection process. So, after replying affirmatively I set out to organize my thoughts and I wrote a speech (first in “Englutch”, which is still the easiest way to organize my thoughts) and translated the whole thing into semiformal Chinese. (For more of my translation projects of Chinese short stories into Dutch, have a look at the project Babel 101).\nI then had a friend (kudos for A-hsing/Mergen!) who helped me ‘Taiwanize’ or ‘Chinefy’ the whole text. After that, it was read over once by Amy from the International Office (IO), followed by a visit in person to that same office and an out-loud rehearsal, followed by a few more adaptions, and a last reading by another department. So, the text was heavily edited, but this was a good thing - I once had given a speech after returning from China and the unedited text I presented did not “fall in good earth”, but that was an interesting experience from which I learnt a lot.\nOkay, if you have been reading so far, I assume you want to see the ceremony and/or know the content of my speech. Your cravings will be fulfilled in a bit. First let us have a look at the stage at wich I was to ‘perform’.\n\n\n\n3C2A7824\n\n\nAs you can see, it was a beautiful stage, in the Administration building. From top to bottom we can see the logo of the university  It features the Fu Szu-nien 傅斯年 bell, which commemorates the fourth rector after taking over the university from the Japanese. You can see _Guoli Taiwan daxue _國立臺灣大學 “National University Taiwan” · _dunpin lixue__ _敦品勵學 “integrity, diligence” · _aiguo airen _愛國愛人 “patriotism, compassionate”. This is translated and adapted in the English motto “Integrity, Diligence, Fidelity, Compassion”.\nBelow that, on the picture, you can see in red letters 104 xueniandu di yi xueqi minglei jiangxuejin banjiang dianli 104學年度第一學期名類獎學金頒獎典禮 “scholarship award ceremony of the first semester of the 104 year [of the ROC, which started in 1911 - yes I’m born in the 80s here in Taiwan]”. Then below that, in calligraphy you can read reqing zhuoyue 熱情卓越 “enthusiastic and outstanding”. Juxtaposed to that, you can read “National Taiwan University - _reqing fuchu _熱情付出 ‘enthusiasm pays off [?]’ _chuangzao zhuoyue _創造卓越 ‘creating excellence’ - Team, Accountability, Integrity, Diligence, Ambition & vision” This last one is an acronym that spells out TAIDA, the common abbreviation in Chinese for my university here.\n\n\n\nIMG_9729\n\n\nOkay, that was a lot to analyze in one picture, but it shows how the stage is important for official affairs. After arriving a bit early on the set - a tip we learnt from Prof. Standaert in Leuven - I got the chance to rehearse a bit. After most awardees arrived, we did a general rehearsal and then the clock struck 12 and the game was on. The officials arrived and we performed the roles we were given - entering the main stage when our name was called. The whole thing was very official and was filmed entirely. But, I assume you are interested in pictures of me and my receival of the scholarship, so here is a picture of that.\n\n\n\n3C2A7888\n\n\nThe woman who hands over the notice is the president of the committee that decides who gets a a scholarship [me! me! me! :D ]. Unfortunately, I kind of forgot her name at the moment, so if a reader can tell met that, I would welcome it very much and edit this piece in the post. After that, it was time for my speech. I got on the stage - well, the tribune was removed so I was standing behind a microphone (with my speech in hand as I had been told would be okay).\n\n\n\n3C2A7928\n\n\nAnd now it’s time for my speech. First the youtube version [GO TO MINUTE 4 FOR ME] to hear my speak: [update in 2024, the youtube link seems to be broken]\nAnd now for the words with translation. I should mention that I wrote this speech with the thoughts of trying to describe what pertained to all the participants - even though that is difficult for I had not met any of them before. So apart from the university and the members involved, I am of course very grateful to all the people who got me here, which in the first place is my parents, but also my previous professors, my current professors and of course my dearest friends:\n\nDear rector, every teacher, every classmate:\nGood afternoon\n(Taiwanese:) “Did you guys eat yet?”\nMy name is Sima Zhi (Thomas Van Hoey). I come from Belgium and am currently doing my PhD at the Graduate Institute of Linguistics in this university. I feel very honoured to represent and speak for all recepients of the Research Fellowship for Outstanding International Doctoral Students.\nFirst of all, I would like to express our luck of being able to come to Taiwan to study.\nIt is, however, not my first time to Taiwan. Last year during the summer, I attended a summer school organised by NTU, called “Translating Chinese”. At the time, I thought Taiwan and NTU were superb – the environment is really nice, the people are super friendly, the culture is so interesting etc. So I figured, if I had the chance, I would definitely come here to study.\nAnd then, in the autumn of 2014, I got an e-mail explaining how NTU would have this kind of scholarship from the beginning of 2015. I was thrilled to hear this news, and I immediately started preparing the required documents.\nThis year in April, I got the news that I was accepted. Furthermore, I had gotten this scholarship. So I was not only happy about it, but also tremendously impressed of getting this change – so many years of studying very hard have finally paid of. And this also encourages further study!\nThen, how to say it, normally students from the Humanities, like me, do not very easily get funding opportunities. However, NTU does not only award scholarships to students from the Medical sciences or the Hard Sciences, but also to the Humanities. I think this shows the balanced spirit of the university and it humbles me.\nSo, what does this scholarship mean to me?\nFirstly, it is a chance to continue studying.\nSecondly, it is a chance to start researching.\nThirdly, it is a chance to deeply experience Taiwanese culture.\nFourthly, it is a chance to meet new friends and establish new connections.\nLastly, it is a chance to help us view the world from a different perspective.\nI firmly believe that if we take this chance, we can change the world.\nIn the Great Learning,one of the Four Books, it is said that:\n“Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.\nThings being investigated, knowledge became complete.\nTheir knowledge being complete, their thoughts were sincere.\nTheir thoughts being sincere, their hearts were then rectified.\nTheir hearts being rectified, their persons were cultivated.\nTheir persons being cultivated, their families were regulated.\nTheir families being regulated, their states were rightly governed.\nTheir states being rightly governed, the whole kingdom was made tranquil and happy.” (tr. James Legge)\nThe ‘investigation of things’ talked about means ‘research’. And it is fundamental. By using this fundamental thing, we can make the world a better place.\nThat is why, I think, no, I am sure that us recipients will exert our utmost efforts to return this chance given by NTU, so we can be proud of ourselves, so NTU can be proud of us, so we can advance the scientific field, and we can make the world a better place.\nThank you for this opportunity.\n\nAfter the speech and the end of the event, there was a lunch event and photo-picture-taking-time event. Here is a pic of me and the rector of NTU (to my right) and the vice-dean of the Faculty of Arts (to my left).\n\n\n\n20151218_133710\n\n\nThis is the Chinese version of the text. It was also published completely in the university newspaper (the article can be found here).\n\n校長、各位師長、各位同學大家好:⋯⋯ 午安（台語：）吃飽沒\n我是司馬智，來自比利時，目前在本校語言學研究所就讀博士，很榮幸今天能代表所有國際學生獎學金獲獎人致詞。\n首先我要說，我們都對能有機會來臺灣讀書感到十分高興。 這不是第一次我來臺灣。我去年夏天的時候，參加臺大舉辦的暑期學校叫《Translating Chinese 翻譯中文》。 當時，覺得臺灣與臺大非常了不起——風景很漂亮，當地人很友好，文化很有趣，諸如此類…，決定如果有機會的話，一定來這邊讀書。\n於是，2014年秋天，我收到e-mail說，臺大從2015年開始，提供優秀博士獎學金。我那時心很高興，馬上準備申請資料。\n今年四月左右，收到了我所嚮往的臺大錄取的消息，同時又獲得這筆獎學金，除了開心，這也給我留下了一個非常深刻的印象。\n多少年的努力學習終於有了回報，讓我們更努力地繼續學習。怎麼說呢？一般來講，人文科學的學生，像我本人，不太容易獲得研究資金。\n但是，台灣大學不只把獎學金發給自然科學與醫學科學等領域的學生，也把獎學金頒給人文科學的學生，代表台大重視各學科平衡發展的精神，讓我感到佩服。這筆獎學金對我的含義是什麼？\n第一，這是一個可以繼續讀書的機會。\n第二，這是一個可以投入研究的機會。\n第三，這是一個可以深刻體驗台灣文化的機會。\n第四，這是一個可以認識新朋友，建立新關係的機會。\n最後，這是一個可以幫助我們從另一個角度看世界的機會。\n我相信如果我們抓緊這些機會，我們就可以改善世界。\n四書的《大學》裡面說道“ 致知在格物 物格而後知至．知至而後意誠．意誠而後心正．心正而後身修．身修而後家齊．家齊而後國治．國治而後天下平” 其中’格物’這個詞在講’研究’，是最基本的東西之一。\n我們可以透過掌握這種基本的東西來建立一個更美好的世界。\n因此，我認為，不，我確信，我們得獎人都會盡最大的努力回報台大給我們的機會，讓我們為自己感到驕傲， 也讓台大為我們感到驕傲，讓我們提高科學的水準，進而讓世界更完美。非常感謝台灣大學給我們這個機會。\n謝謝大家\n\n  And, finally, as a last picture: it is the degree itself! Congratulations if you made it this far - next time I will talk about Christmas and New Year! #CatchingUpAfterBengKui"

    "text": "Hi everyone, I would like to start this post with a video of a recent earwurm: Madonna’s Holiday. It has been stuck in my head so much that it made it to title of this post. The video below features her dancing in the worst possible manner. So enjoy it, and then read the real content of this update: how I celebrated Christmas, New Year and the end of the term.\nAs was explained in the last update, the end of the semester is quite busy here in Taiwan. There is no official Christmas holiday here, let alone a Boxing Day (which in my home country is known as Second Christmas Day, but counts as an official holiday just as much). So, even though there are Christmas trees and markets galore, I had a lighter Christmas than in China in 2012.\nChristmas Eve I spent with my French friend Léo and our mutual Chinese friend Qi. We ate pizza after roaming the streets for more than an hour looking for a place that wasn’t fully booked. It was delicious, just as Chinese natives tend to ask as a standard question for hao chi ma  好吃嗎? “Does it taste good?”. It probably stems from a textbook translation, but delicious is a BIG WORD in English (or in Dutch delicieus or French _délicieux _for that matter). However, we had a good laugh and a good evening.\nOn Christmas Day I first went to my class of Corpus Linguistics, where the sympathetic Hsieh laoshi told us that the class would be over after the presentation of our classmate. Thank you! However, I still had the afternoon class, so it was not a ‘real holiday’. Later that night we ate… PITA, because what screams more the word Christmas than a Middle-Eastern dish I loved eating (though not excessively) in Leuven? After that we went to a bar. We, that is me, the French guy, the Chinese guy and a few Malaysian people who I’ve come to like a lot. I was really happy with the bar, because they were serving Belgian beer. Here are two pictures of me posing with beers:\n\n\nHowever, that was not the only Christmassy thing that we did! My department also organized a Christmas party. It was a really nice show with performances by groups of students, a gift-exchange-game and a nice plate of pasta. Yes, yes, the Christmas spirit was strong in the food.\n\n\n\nDave, me, Lu laoshi and CK - our lab\n\n\n\n\n\nThe master students singing “You raise me up”\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and Su laoshi while we are the theme of Christmas food\n\n\nMe and Su laoshi while we are the theme of Christmas food - here is a picture of me eating a hamburger :D It was a bit of an overkill, all this fastish food, but I want to assure you that most of my diet consists of rice, meat and vegetables.\n\n\n\nHamburger\n\n\nAnd I also had a nice evening with my Catalonian (not Spanish :p ) friend Nacho and a few of his friends, as well as a visit from Brigitte, Katrin’s friend (see almost all  my posts of my time in China). I am subsequently at a pool table and the main gate of my university:\n\n\n\nnot a swimming pool\n\n\n\n\n\ngate of NTU\n\n\nOkay, time for New Year! I was invited by my classmate Dave (cf. supra) to spend the evening with him and his friends. We ate Malaysian food, because what screams more New Year than Malaysian food? :D Then we went to Taipei 101, which is sometimes referred to as (Taipei) 202 in a running joke among the locals. What will follow now is a series of pictures of the fireworks - by far the most impressive fireworks I have ever seen, because they launch them from 202. Just a shame that it only lasted for about 1.5 minutes*.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see (you can see more by clicking left and right on the pictures), it was beautiful! It was also very crowded - a phenomenon that is called ren shan ren hai 人山人海 ‘people mountain people sea’ in Chinese. After the fireworks show some people left, but most seemed to stay for a New Year performance by A-Mei 張惠妹. I was not particularly familiar with her songs, but I really liked the concert. I was joking that she should sing a song by Jay Chou 周杰倫, my favourite singer and she did （at around 25:45), as well as May Day 五月天 (at 57:00): So I was watching the concert with my friends, and I had one of the most wonderful New Year Eves ever. Even though I am far from home, I still kind of felt at my place and I really want to thank my friends for that. That is why I put up the following pics of them (I don’t have better quality of that night).\n\n\n\nDave and Kazuki\n\n\n  Apart from being a great singer who got fined about four times for singing too loudly on NYE, A-Mei is also a gay icon, as can be seen from the rainbows in this picture:\n\n\n\n2016-01-01 00.49.53\n\n\nAnd the song that made the crowd go wild was San tian san ye 三天三夜 ‘Three days and three nights’. In the previous video it can be found at 1:12:30. The whole crowd went completely crazy with this girl. And I love how her voice is completely broken at the end of the concert. That’s how I think KTV should end, otherwise you’re doing something wrong. The lyrics of the song are really funny:\n\nI’m not tired at all I’ve been dancing for three days and three nights In my current mood I could drink water and get drunk Oh Not tired at all I’m going to dance for three days and three nights more My mood is so light I could fly\nOK OK join my ranks No K No K from day to night Always always happy but not sad No way no way who would say not to that?\n\nSo, that was about it for my holidays update. There are still some more pictures from pizza and dinner parties at the end of the semester to celebrate our survival. Of course, end of the semester also means saying goodbye to some of my friends who were here for the first semester and then went back home. Nice meeting you guys!\n*Maybe the tower was experiencing ejaculatio praecox?"

    "title": "A Visit from Vietnam",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last update discussed the beginning of January and the beginning of my winter holiday. In this update I will report how I received a visitor from Vietnam and showed him around.\n\nDay 1: CKS  \nI met my Vietnamese friend Quoc Anh during his study abroad in Belgium last year. In fact, you can read about some of his adventures on his blog. He’s got some family in Kaohsiung 高雄, a main city in the South of Taiwan and after travelling North via the East coast, he came to the Northwest of the country - Taipei.\nThe first day, after a lecture on the perdurant vs. endurant properties inherent in Chinese classifiers and measure words, we met and went to Chiang Kai-shek Memorial hall. This is the mausoleum for Taiwan’s nationalist leader and it looks like a giant white building, arguably in the political center of Taiwan.\n\nOn top of the building, after you climbed the 88 steps that represent General Chiang’s (蔣中正 Chiang Chung-cheng - yes I am aware this sounds like the prototypical idea of what Chinese sounds like in Dutch, viz. ching chang chong), you get a wonderful view of the Freedom Square (自由廣場) and the National Theater and National Concert Hall on either side.\n\n\n\nInside you can see the statue of Chiang Chung-cheng, looking over the Taipei he governed for many a year. There’s writing on the wall (and ceiling for that matter), as well as the hourly change of guard ceremony.\n\n\nDownstairs you can see some exhibitions that deal with aspects of his life. Like clothes he wore, two cars he was driven in (I am not sure if a lot of great world leaders can drive a car actually), him sitting at a reconstructed desk, pictures of his wife Soong Mei-ling 宋美齡 - one of the three So(o?)ng sisters that played a somewhat significant part in history and were scattered across the globe: Taiwan, Mainland China (Ching-ling, Mrs. Sun Yat-sen) and America (Ai-ling). My old Chinese teacher (n.b. old as in former, not necessarily old age lest he read this) Dirk (狄老師) wrote his thesis about them in the 1980s.\n\n\nLater that night, I had big plans with Quoc Anh - who will appear in a moment in pictures. We were going to a concert by the National Taiwan University Student Choir. So we went to the National Concert Hall at night.\n\n\nHere is one of the songs they performed that night, 風平浪靜.\nTo be honest, I liked their singing but I did fall asleep for a moment. This was probably because I did not come there for all the liturgical songs, but for the exciting performances like this performance of the theme song When you believe from my favourite children’s movie, The Prince of Egypt. It is also worth mentioning that my classmate Umy sings with them.\n\n\nDay 2: Gugong\nThe next day we went to the National Palace Museum; the one they have here (as opposed to the one in Beijing, the Forbidden City) is also called Gugong 故宮 in Chinese, to make things even more confusing. It hosts a lot of precious artifacts that were conveniently transported to Taiwan during the last years of nationalist reign on Mainland (or at least that is the story I’ve beent told). And now you finally get to see a pic of me and Quoc Anh in front of the Gugong.\n\n\nThings that I secretly took pictures of in the museum include some nice pottery, the Chinese character for my Chinese first/last name and a horsehead that makes this smiley :P .\n\n\n\nNext to the Palace Museum, there is the Zhishan 至善 garden, which looks a lot like the gardens found in my beloved Suzhou (see almost everything published on this blog before 2014). It features two lakes, fish, zig-zag (ideophone!) bridges, a policeman that scares you away and a guzheng with broken strings that can be used by foreigners to take funny pictures with.\n\n\n\n\nDay 3: Confucius, tea and ‘Modern Art’\nSince the weather was getting increasingly cold, I opted for looking more inside-things to visit. Still, we first went to the Confucius temple on day three, which is my favourite temple to visit in Taipei. It’s next to the Bao’an Gong (also a temple) so you get two temples for the price of none because they are free. Don’t miss the 4D movie experience that is also offered freely by the temple people. I like how they tried to modernize/update Confucius to also teach children and people interested in some tenets of the Ru 儒 (which is actually the name for what we tend to call Confucianism in the West). They have devoted six places in the temple to the six arts, complete with interactive things to do, stamps to collect and informative notes:\n\nRites 禮\nMusic 樂\nArchery 射\nCharioteering 御\nCalligraphy 書\nMathematics 數\n\nThey can be grouped together in groups of two, so you get the ones that stimulate teamwork (1-2), the ones that strengthen the body (3-4) and strengthen the mind (5-6).\n\n\n\n (This is the Bao’an Gong)\nLate we went to the nearby Taipei Story House, which featured an exhibition on teapots. Yes, teapots. Interested readers can look at more pictures by clicking left on the pic below.\n\nAfter that we went to the even nearer byer Taipei Fine Arts Museum. We saw three main things:\n\nPaintings by Su Wong-shen\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Way things go”, a symbiosis of physics and art. Especially mesmerizing was the bubble machine.\n\n\n\nThe Taipei Art Awards (or something like that), proving that art can be interpreted very broadly. Here are some interesting pieces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 4: Xiangshan, the Elephant Mountain\nOn day 4 we went to Xiangshan 象山, Elephant Mountain, from where you have a nice view of the Taipei skyline. We met my Japanese friend Toranari-san.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that we had a quick visit to respectively Ximen and my university - mind you, it was the coldest temperature in Taipei in 50 years or so at this moment, a mere 4 degrees and I can tell you that is very cold in a wet climate. There was even snow, a nearly unheard thing of in these parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\nDay 5: Lilliput\nOn the last day, Quoc Anh’s very nice family drove North and took us to Xiao ren guo 小人國 - a mini Taiwan/Asia/World theme park. I had a very nice time there - the weather looked much better and the sights were very interesting. It was like walking through my lonely planet and I couldn’t stop taking pictures of things I still need to visit. There was no Belgian building, so that’s a pity, but the day was great. Here are some pictures, because they say more than a thousand words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater that night I took Quoc Anh to a place with Belgian beer, because he said he missed it. Here he is with some Liefmans.\n\nAnd on the last day, we stopped to buy new shows for him. Here is a final selfie with him, his Vietnamese aunt, and me. I just realized that is was so funny - we all spoke different languages with each other: I spoke English with him, he spoke Vietnamese with his aunt and his aunt spoke Chinese with me.\n\nSo this visit came to an end. Next I had an ‘Artsy-Fartsy Afternoon’ followed by a Visit from Japan. See you folks!"

    "text": "Today’s update is the first part of a double post that aims at filling you in with some details of my life here. This part is the more pictoral part. The second part about conferences is more academic. As always, comments are welcome on all kinds of platforms.\n\nWhere were we?\nWhere were we again since last time? Ah yes, I was visited by friends from Japan. Well, lots of things have happened in between then and now. I received my grades — yes, everything passed well!\n\n\nFebruary\nI also started a new semester. This time I took three courses:\n\nThe seminar course of my supervisor Lu Chiarung, like I did last semester. This one is kind of mandatory but also very interesting, because it’s in this course that I can develop my research most profoundly.\nA course on how language relates to culture. This I took because this is of course a very interesting relationship to further explore and I was also very curious to see what my wonderful classmates had to say about how they experienced the themes we touched on.\nFieldwork. In this class the teacher (Song Li-May) focuses on an aborigine language of Taiwan. The largest language family, in terms of different languages, on Earth is that of the Austronesian languages - spanning from Taiwan to the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and even to Hawaii. It turns out that these originated mostly from Taiwan. So, the language we are focusing (pun intended for those linguists among you who have dealt with Austronesian languages) on is Bunun. But the news about that course will be for a future update, this was just a trailer.\n\n\n\nMarch\nThe most fun that happened in March was a trip to Taizhong 台中, one of the major cities in Taiwan. It was kind of organised by my dear Spanish friend Guillermo, whose grandmother is Dothraki “because the Dothraki scenes in Game of Thrones are filmed in his region, Navarra in (e)Spain. Anyway, I come along really well with him and he is kind of my best foreign friend here. To get an idea of how crazy he can be, guess who is dancing in this costume:\nSo, he is a budding architect and was a finalist of a competition for the design of a small local temple. In the end he didn’t win, even though I think he had the best concept: since it was a very local temple, he wanted the people to come together and transform the temple into some sort of community centre. Central to his design was the concept of growing plants like bamboo that would grow and be cut with the rythm of the traditional celebrations in the lunar calendar. From a sinological point-of-view, my only question was about the intercalary months, those perky months that are sometimes thrown to align the lunar and the solar calendar every so often. I’ll show you a few pics of his concept and the design.\n\n\n\nNow, if we’re talking about the look of the temple, I felt that the three finalists did deserve to win. As a tourist and a layman theirs was a grander design and I think I would want to visit those kind of temples. Here are three final designs; let me know which one you think should have won.\n\n\n\nContinuing our architecturally inspired trip of Taizhong — this perspective of visiting a place was very fresh and intresting to me — we went to Tunghai University 東海大學, apparently the first private and second oldest university in Taiwan. It houses the Luce Memorial Chapel, a wonder of architecture designed by renowned architect I.M. Pei 貝聿銘. Now, before you scroll down to the pictures of the chapel with me in front of them “pics or it didn’t happen”, remember that this guy grew up in my dearest Suzhou, where I studied a year abroad (check, like, my whole blog in 2012-2013) and he thought the Lion Garden 獅子林 was an ideal playground. Why oh why didn’t I get to play around in that garden when I was younger?? Anyway, famous places designed by mr. Pei include lesser known (well, to me) American projects, the museum of Suzhou, the well known Bank of China tower in Hong Kong and and and, the great pyramid of the Louvre. Don’t call Pei 貝 a Mo 莫 (‘nobody’, haha, stupid joke, referring to Mo Yan the Nobel Prize Winner). Anyhow, here is the beautiful chapel:\n\n\nAnd the most colourful thing we visited in Taizhong was this small Rainbow Village 彩虹眷村. Defying the authorities who were keen on relocating people for building projects, this old Papa Rainbow decided to just paint every land and building he owned, in order to attract visitors and hopefully keep the village the way it was — well, the colourful way it had become. I this case, pictures do say more than words, so let’s hear it for the pictures!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the end of March my dear Belgian-Taiwanese friend Hsuan came, as he he used to do in Belgium, to visit me because he moved back to Taiwan. Here he is looking like a soldier.\n\n\n\nApril\nNow comes a really nice part, and a very sad part at the end.\nI went back home in the beginning of April, because there were many celebrations to be done, as every year. First I had my birthday. This year I was in the air when that happened, but don’t worry, I had leg space and the good service of Emirates. Prior to that, I had a mini celebration in Taipei with my long time friend Snow, some of my classmates, and my friend Lucio.\n\n\n\n\n12472369_857349487744386_4676526778379631759_n\n\n\n\n\nSo, back home I of course had a nice birthday dinner. First with my mom, and later that week I had cheese and wine night with my ex-classmates of Sinology, and later with my dad:\n\n\n\n\n\nThen of course there were other reunions that had to be done. I was brought together again (those who didn’t notice, this is the title of this update) not only with my ex-classmates, but also with my super good friends from high school and beyond (it’s a shame that I don’t have a picture of this :( ) as well as my friends from my student organisation that had their annual election week and I got to participate in some activities.\n\n\n\nThen there was of course my dad’s birthday (Happy birthday dad!) and my grandfathers’s birthday who became 80 years old this year (hurray!), so those were of course also very joyous occasions.\nAnd that about concludes most of the time spent in Belgium. I was really happy to see everyone again and realized that I do kind of miss them in Taiwan, but thinking of them always makes me happy. I have good friends and good family. This high note is now followed by a sad part.\n\n\nJack\nThe saddest part about going home this year was I had to say good-bye to my dear dog Jack, who was by my side for 16.5 years and like a real family member. I have thought long and hard about writing whether I should write about him or not on this blog, but I wish to remember this moment and share it with you. I wil just write the eulogy I wrote on facebook — thanks for all the support by the way.\n\n\n\n\nMy dearest Jack,\n\n\nFor over 16 years — 2 thirds of my life — you have been there for me. And there are no words good enough to express my sorrow. When I got that call that I didn’t want to get tonight, I wasn’t ready to let you go. Just four more days and I could have petted you one day more; watch your tail wag left and right for hours and just take comfort in knowing that you were sleeping comfortably, lying there on your red blanket enjoying those shallow Belgian sunbeams.\n\n\nAfter an episode tonight I got that call and with tears in my eyes I realized it was time to let you go, on to that eternal slumber. You were the smartest dog I could ever imagine and were like a sibling I never had. And whilst I type this eulogy, I can’t seem to choose ‘my best moment’ with you. All the moments I spent with you flash before my eyes as the words appear on my screen. I remember choosing a dog with that quaint dot on his back and taking him home a few weeks later, a pocket size dog that didn’t know what was happening to him. Getting out of the car, I discovered that you had wet yourself on my lap because of this traumatizing experience.\n\n\nBut you recovered, you adapted and you became used to your life with us. I admire how quickly you learnt certain things and I remember fondly how you liked to play with footballs and kangaroo balls and trampolines. Or those times that you were flying around the room jumping on all the furniture because that was what you did when playing. When you dug a hole in the couch, when you learnt how to beg for food, when you found yourself in a new house for the first time and finally learnt how to climb stairs — your life would never be the same again. When you discussed presumably very intersting dog topics with neighbour dogs, when you only cared to bark at other dogs that were at least four times as big as you, when you were selective in whose cookies you accepted, when you attacked the biggest threat to your life – the vaccuum cleaner – when you greeted me for so long after I went away for longer periods of time, when you wouldn’t leave my side after I came from China; when… so many whens.\n\n\nIt all happened and is happening again right at this moment. You made a lasting impression on my life by enriching it in too many ways. I remember you slowly going blind but not giving up, I remember you losing weight these last weeks; so much that it slowly sank in that it was time to let you go. I remember you being there for me whenever I needed it, except for that one time that I got that unfortunate call today and you weren’t.\n\n\nAnd as sung by Annie Lennox: “Lay down, your sweet and weary head; night is falling, you have come to journey’s end.” Sleep now, my dearest Jack, you have deserved your rest. I will remember you for the rest of my life and even longer. Solum requiescas in pacem.\n\n\nYour Thomas\n\n\n~~Jack Van Hoey ~~ 9 November 1999 – 1 April 2016 ~~\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking his final mark\n\n\nAnyway, let’s all hope he’s in a better place now. A sad song referenced to above to end this update. Thank you patient reader."

    "text": "After my previous double update — in case you missed it, here are the links to Brought together 1 and Brought together 2 - go check’m out! — I was visited by two of my best friends. I want to thank both Yoana and Tessa for taking the time to visit me and endure my guiding tour. After they had left, I had to prepare for my fieldwork class. This year Professor Sung Li-May is focusing on Bunun, one of the 15 or so indigenous languages that can be found in Taiwan. They are Austronesian languages, which means they belong to the same language family as Philippine languages, Indonesian languages and many more. They spread out all the way until Hawaii (yes, Hawaiian is an Austronesian language) and New-Zealand (Maori), so it is very probably the biggest language family or the one that covers the biggest territory.\n\n\n\nMAP OF BUNUN\n\n\nAll these languages seem to originate from the island of Taiwan, which is, as you know, the place I am studying. Since this island used to be called Ilha Formosa ‘beautiful island’ by the Portuguese, the subbranch of Austronesian languages that can be found here are known as the Formosan languages — this variation is “Taiwan’s gift to the world”. There is ample archeological evidence that supports the move from Taiwan to the Philippines to the West and then to the East (Bellwood 2000; Oppenheimer 2001). And one of the languages that can be found in this group is Bunun in Taiwan. Above is a map of the places where it’s spoken.\nIt is spoken by the Bunun tribe, whose massive migration of Bunun started around the turn of the 18th century, i.e. about 300 years ago. The Bunun tribe was originally settled in the midwest of Taiwan, all in Hsinyi county. It dispersed to the south and east. The first subgroup to migrate was Takupulan, which had been resettled to the south of Tsou by the mid-18th century. Then there were two main waves of dispersal: The first to the south and southeast, and the second to the west and southwest, including Isbukun, Takivatan and Takbanuaz subgroups. The latest migration was the northern subgroup, including Takituduh and Takibakha (Li 2004).\nThey are mostly known for two things: one is the coming-of-age Ear-Shooting ceremony, called malahtania; the other is polyphonic singing pasibutbut. Here is a video of them singing:\n\nCurrently there are about 50,000 Bununs still alive (De Busser 2011). They are traditionally divided into five dialects: Isbukun, Takivatan (cf. De Busser 2009 — yes, the specialist on this dialect is Belgian), Takbanuaz, Takituduh, and Takibakha. Taki means ‘from-‘; and the dialect we studied, Isbukun, is also known as Bubukun. It is estimated to mean something like ‘the Bunun people’. And bunun itself just means ‘human’.\nThe goal of this course, because it is still schoolwork, is to add to the database of Formosan languages that is being developed by my institute. For this we had a teacher every week in our class who we could ask questions to. In this way we elicited more and more language data, for a total of 27 hours. And from 2 June until 6 June we went ‘into the field’ as it is known, to gather more data by talking with three very helpful informants. I will now try to give an overview of our trip:\n\nDay 1\n\nWe woke up really early to take the early Highspeed Railway to Zuoying 左營, where we consequently were split in two vans. I must point out that we were about 13 people in total and that the vans were thus very big. We were taken into the mountains. Before I had a lot of expectations and romantized thoughts about the village were bound for, which was called Taoyuan 桃源 (not the one with the airport) in Chinese, or Kavalung in Bunun — “Do they live in normal houses? Is there electricity? Is there internet? Is there water? Do they live in tents? …” What I found was just a normal village in the country/mountainside. They are very modernized, but from what I gathered they still care about their heritage as hunters. So we got to know our informants and started working: asking novel sentences (or reaffirming old ones) in orde to explore the different uses of different bits and pieces of the language. We worked for about three hours per session, a rhythm that would repeat itself in the next few days with about two sessions every day.\n\nWe stayed in a few rooms above/behind a church. It is very obvious that the Bunun people we met are a closely knitted community with a lot of adherents of Christianity (there seem to be both Presbyterian and Catholic variants in Kavalung). There were three big rooms and one smaller and eventually I slept in the same room as the teacher because that way I had more space. The last day we were joined by girls who had fled their room because of cockroach problems.\n\n\n\nDay 2\nWaking up around 7 AM (actually a bit before because my classmates are very active in the morning), we went to a breakfast place which enticed us to become regulars in the few days we were there. Things that happened on this included a confirmation that living in the mountains offers ever-changing beautiful landscapes, so that is what you will get a lot of pictures of.\n\n\n\nI also attracted a crowd of young fans who kept calling me ‘america’. They asked me if I came from the US (Meiguo 美國), England (Yingguo 英國), or ‘Abroad’ (Waiguo 外國). The structure of these words in Chinese makes it seem as if ‘Abroad’ really is a country. When I asked to show it on the local map that hang there, she just pointed at a part that wasn’t highlighted — not even leaving the South of Taiwan. It was very innocent but also very funny. I may have been the first danghashulbu ‘red-hair &gt; foreigner’ that they have every seen in their lives.\n\n\n\nDay 3\nThe daily rhythm continued, and our materials kept growing. However, on this day there was a unique event in the village: a wedding! In these pictures below must be a significant amount of remaining Bununs. Notice the guy who poses for my picture in the second pic below.\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 4\nOn the next day we had a field trip in the area. We got to see a family member of the Bunun leader Lāhè āléi 拉荷·阿雷 (1869-1941) who opposed the Japanese occupation of their Bunun territories. And we got the whole story of how this happened.\n\n\nThis was also the spot where I ‘married’ three women at once, an inside joke that followed from my story of how my fortune was told to my by a crone in the Eslite bookstore #truestory. I was going to mary three women in my life, move back to America and would do a host of other improbable things. Here is the picture of the proposal and the result.\n\n\n\nwedding\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 5\nAll good things come to an end. So too our stay with the Bunun. As if the mountain god didn’t want to see us leave it started raining so hard, we had to stay just a bit longer.\n\nBut our time there came to and end and I know I will definitely go back to visit them, especially our dear Yan laoshi, or Hanaivaz in Bunun, who is one of the kindest people I have ever met.\n\n\n\nReturning to Taipei\n\nAfter having returned to Taipei, we had to give a presentation on the linguistic topic we were working on in Bunun. In my case, that was nominalization and relativization. And eventually we had to turn that into a term paper, which I made accessible here (I’m welcoming comments!):\n\n\nPaper on Relativization and Nominalization in Isbukun Bunun\n\n\nAll in all, it was wonderful and I really recommend this class to everyone who wants to analyze a new language they have no experience with — a chance that is nearly impossible to get in Belgium in the setting we had it here. Here is a final picture of the group on the mountainside, with the clouds hanging lower because of recent rainfall."

    "text": "A long overdue update, but my friends have implored me to write it down. In the last update I talked about the Artsy Fartsy Afternoon I had after my Visit from Vietnam. Today my treat for you is a Visit from Japan and how I spent Chinese New Year 2016.\n\nUnder the Bamboo\nLast year, my dear Japanese friend Takeshita 竹下 “Under the bamboo” came to visit me and Joke in Belgium and we had a wonderful time. She had been a classmate of us in Suzhou. This is my favourite picture I have of her, entitled “Takeshita under the bamboo” 竹下の竹下.\n\n\n\n竹下の竹下\n\n\nAt the end of January she came for a weekend to Taipei, all the way from Japan. She had so much luggage with her — a whole handbag. She told me that the flight attendants were perplexed, and so was I. However, I think it was magical, like Harry Potter, for she seemed to be able to find everything she needed at a whim, and we all know that is not a given with the vast oceans that women’s purses often are.\nWe first went to the Confucius temple (note: I have written about these temples and spots before, so just read more posts on my blog if you want to know more about them), where we did the customary jumping picture.\n\n\n\nTakeshita jumping with Confucius\n\n\nAfterwards, we saw how clean they kept the Bao’an temple, by using a toothbrush. I wonder which toothpaste they use to clean though.\n\n\n\nBrushing those stelae\n\n\nLater we went to Jiufen, but it was raining and misty, so it wasn’t that much fun. However, I think she had some fun because she got to see the teahouse from the award winning anime movie Spirited Away. Here is the teahouse with Takeshita:\n\nThe next day, the weather gods were nicer to us. We went to see Chiang Kai-Shek’s and Sun Yat-sen’s memorial halls, saw Taipei 101 – the big tower –, had lunch in Din Tai Fung and went inside the City Hall. Here’s pics:\n\n\n\n\nLastly, I had to say goodbye to Takeshita, after a pleasant weekend of catching up and sightseeing. But not before taking a melodramatic selfie at the airport bus and the obligatory funny picture, “Sailor Bamboo”:\n\n\n\n\nSailor Moonの竹下\n\n\n\n\nAn Suhi-\nAbout a week later it was that time of the year in the Chinese world — Chinese New Year 2016. First I had a small celebration organised by the university for those students who would not be going home. There were two foreigners (I mean, possibly more, but I only saw myself and a Latin kind of guy at the far end of the room) and I was seated with people I didn’t know and who cared more for their phones than for conversation or food. Nevertheless, it was a nice kind of show they wanted to do and we even got red envelopes from the university, so thank you NTU! At the end of the evening there were some funny fotoshoot moments which I will share with you:\n\n\n\nThe next day I had a new visit from Japan! This time my very good friend Ann-Sofie, who succeeded me as president of my student organisation Eoos, and here Korean friend Su-chan came to visit me. They were both studying at Kobe University and their academic year, which starts in March in japan, had just ended. I was very happy to see her (well, them) and speak some normal Dutch again. First we spent some time roaming around Ximen, where their hostel was located, and tried to find some food. This was not an easy task because everything was almost closing for the big celebration that night. Fortunately we were able to go to some temples, like a very clean Bao’an temple:\n\nHow did we celebrate Chinese New Year you may ask. Well, we went to my almost adopted/host family — my good friend Hsuan’s family — for the big celebration. A-ma had cooked so much super tasty food and it was just delicious and just so much and it was such a fun night. Here is our family picture:\n\n\n\nFamily picture CNY 2016\n\n\nThe next days, the weather gods still seemed appeased and allowed us to visit my campus, the presidential palace, the old hospital (Taiwan’s Gasthuisberg for my medicine student friends at home).\n\n\n\nWe also went to the Palace Museum, where there was a new exhibition about Catholic missionaries etc. I got to see the world map the Belgian Jesuit priest Ferdinand Verbiest 南懷仁, who became the court astronomer to the Qing Kangxi 康熙 Emperor (1661-1722) and is very important for European-Chinese relations during the later Empire.\n\n\nThe latter part of the visit was filled with trips going to Tamsui (this deserves a future post), night markets, hat shopping, Din Tai Fung, Jiufen and Maokong. Here are some pictures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, there is a group photo, rather unprofessionally taken against the light (this was my idea), of a very nice moment. Thank you for visiting me, Su-chan and アンスヒー!*\n\n*Ann-Sofie always complains about people not writing her name correctly. I did the same to her one time, even though I didn’t do it intentionally, I wrote her name as アンスヒー rather than アンスフィー. #sorrynotsorry"

So, let’s start with a nice January 28 afternoon that I spent exploring the buildings at the Nanhai Xueyuan 南海學園 “Nanhai Academy” site, situated between the MRT stations of Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall (see last post) and Xiaonanmen. After that, there are a few more works I want to show, as well as the major piece of evidence that witches are among us."

Anyway, Wang Nong was also a student of Xu Beihong, and it shows. In his ink style, he uses light touches to suggest form rather than depict it. I am quite fond of this kind of painting, and it should be one of the main differences between photography and painting - as an amateur (ex-)painter, I also feel that you can put more into a painting than into a picture.

    "text": "Today’s update is the second part of a double post that aims at filling you in with some details of my life here. This part is the more academic part about conferences; the other part you can find here. As always, comments are welcome on all kinds of platforms.\n\nConferences\nConference. That is the key-word of this update. An English word originating from Latin con-ferre ‘together-bring’ (read: ‘bring together’), passing through French. Well we are talking about academic conferences here, ’cause I just started doing that.\nOf course I had done presentations for friends, maybe foes, classmates etc. but I never really attended a conference before. This is in contrast to one of the requirements of the master’s programme here at the GIL of NTU, viz. you have to attend an international conference (it’s not a requirement of the PhD programme; however, it’s strongly advised). In Belgium this was kind of impossible or at least impractical because most masters in the humanities are only one year long. So it was kind of exciting for me when I decided to submit proposals in order to go speak at a conference this year. That’s why I will try to describe the process I went through this year.\n\n\nFinding conferences\nFirst I had to find out about conferences. For me before, this had always been some sort of difficult point. I mean, how do you find out about it long enough beforehand in order for you to write a decent proposal that hopefully incorporates some of the work you have been doing until then? Wow, that is a long sentence. It all became more clear to me this year:\n\nYou have to subscribe ‘social networks’ for the field you are in. In my case that is mostly Linguistlist. Or at least you have to know about it, so you can check vacancies and other interesting stuff regularly.\nYou become a member of certain ‘clubs’ — if that is the right word to put it. For instance, I am a (student) member of the alumni organisation Sinalumni for ex-sinology students, the European Association for Chinese Studies (EACS), and more recently the International Cognitive Linguistics Association (ICLA) for which I was kind of convinced by my previous teacher Dirk Geeraerts. There’s many more where those came from (internet) and it’s a good way to stay updated.\nYou get updates from your department. In this case, our dear Mei-Ling sends us regular updates on interesting talks (my department hosts many) and interesting conferences.\nLuck. Yes, you have to have a wee bit of luck. Maybe it’s a poster you see somewhere, maybe it’s a LinkedIn post, a facebook link, something someone tells you about, a random string of letters you type into google… Who knows.\n\nAnyway, in my cases it was mostly LinguistList and the department that told me.\n\n\nSubmitting a proposal\nAfter you found a conference, you will want to submit a proposal; at least, if your aim is to be super actively involved there. If you want to attend (and mingle with some people), that is also okay of course.\n\n\n“The more you come out, the better.”\n\n\nI wrote my first submissions around December 2015 and got answers pretty soon after that. I submitted for CLDC 8 (see below), a summer school in Leiden (see future blog post) and a symposium in Berlin (see future blog post). And then I got notified that I got accepted, which I was thrilled about.\nAs a warm-up and given my non-existing prior experience with conferences, I decided to attend one so I could see how the show rolls.\n\n\nNCL 17 (2016, Tatung University)\nI went to NCL 17, the (Taiwanese) National Conference on Linguistics. It was hosted at Tatung University 大同大學. It was very interesting to see; especially because I got to see my senpai 學長 Chester present a paper he had been writing last semester, as well as to see my supervisor Lu Chiarung and my other teachers be present and just in general show my face.\n\n\n\nNCL\n\n\n\n\n\nChester speaks\n\n\n\n\n\nLu laoshi speaks\n\n\n\n\nCLDC 8 (2016, Taipei University)\nThis is the main part of this post, as it is the first conference I spoke at. CLDC, the Conference on Language, Discourse, and Cognition is a biennial conference organised by my university NTU. It originated from a smaller set of discussions and has grown out to be a bigger conference that welcomes both Taiwanese as well as foreign talks.\n\n\n\nSally and Mergen setting up the posters\n\n\nWhile the conference itself was held from 13 to 14 May, the first pre-session by keynote speaker Harald Baayen happened a day earlier, when he showed us the wondrous world of R — that’s a computer programme for statistics, for those who R ignorant of this fact (note: in Dutch I would have said that “je geen R-varing hebt”). Professor Baayen is very famous in computational linguistics and his talk was interesting; the subsequent hands-on session was more difficult to follow though.\nThe next day we had our first set of presentations, you can find the conference programme here. In the morning my previous teacher, Professor Dirk Geeraerts from KU Leuven gave a talk on onomasiological variation and lectometry, especially with regard to the lexical field of clothing terms in Flanders vs. the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nDirk Geeraerts ‘onomasiological variation and lectometry’\n\n\nThe rest of the day was filled with very interesting presentations and a poster session for which some of my classmates had submitted a proposal, e.g. Aarin about the dapat ‘to get’ in Indonesian.\n\n\n\nAarin ‘dapat’\n\n\nAt night there was a banquet, where I finally got to eat dryish spaghetti — as opposed to the variant that is too moist that is served ubiquitously here. And, I got to sit at the table with the ‘grown-ups’ (read: with the professors), talking in Dutch and English and Chinese with friendly people.\n\n\n\nbanquet\n\n\n\n\n\nbanquet\n\n\nThe very next day it was my turn to deliver my speech that I had prepared together with my supervisor. It was entitled “The distribution of ideophones in Tang poems: A variatonist perspective”. In short, I summarized findings from my MA thesis last year as a corpus-driven approach to look at three variations mangmang 茫茫, mangmang 芒芒 and cangmang 蒼茫 in a corpus-based way. Turns out that while all three depict ‘wide, open, vast’, the ones with the water radical (the two falling and one raising stripes at the left side) occurred in different places and different times closer to water than the one with only grass (that’s the second one with the two plus signs (++) at the top). It was a good pilot study and I am happy to announce that we will try to publish it in the future!\nI don’t know if you would like to see the powerpoint of the presentation, but if you do, I can send it or in case requests are overwhelming, I might upload it here. Let me know! Anyway, here are some pictures (I am still waiting for better quality pictures than Facebook quality):\n\n\n\npresentation\n\n\n\n\n\npresentation\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was followed by another host of interesting presentations. I think my favourite one was the one right behind me, by Hsin-Yen who talked about iconicity in paintings. Later that night we went for tea shopping with our esteemed guests from the low countries and I had dinner with Prof. Geeraerts and Po-Wei.\n\n\n\ntea time\n\n\nDuring the tea tasting I had a really funny yet embarrassing story that I want to share with you. First we were helped by a very old man, who turned out to be about 85 years old. At one point he left to take a rest and the woman in the picture above helped us further out. I asked her if the old man was her father (fuqin 父親), to which she mumbled something back that I understood as agong 阿公, the Taiwanese Mandarin variant for ‘grandfather’. So, to be certain, I repeated the question, and she was like “no, no, my laogong 老公 ‘husband’. Turned out she was 65 years old. Will I ever be able to guess the age of my Asian friends??\n\n\n\ndinner\n\n\nHowever, it wasn’t the only time I would see Po-Wei that night as it was also the grand finale of the Eurovision Song Contest (Eurosong for the Dutch speaking friends). Ever since the beginning of this academic year it has been clear that he is a super fan and I am happy that we could arrange to watch the competition on big screen in our department, even if it was only the two of us who watched, starting at 3 AM. This, by the way, is not the first time I watched this ‘late’ [I like to watch this live], as I had done the same with Joke in Suzhou two years before. Anyways, Po-Wei was ecstatic when his favourite contestant, Ukraine’s Jamala with 1944, won the contest.\n\n\n\nEurovision!\n\n\n\n\n\nEurovision\n\n\nOf course, the real winners that night were presenters Måns Zelmerlöw and Petra Mede who performed what they thought to be the “perfect Eurovision song”. Of course, it was an act that would have been disqualified in the real competition — having more than six people on stage and going easily over the maximum duration of 3 minutes.\nSo, naturally I almost didn’t sleep (2 hours in total) and I didn’t get a chance to catch up. The next day I guided Prof. Geeraerts and Prof. Chiang Wen-yu in the Palace Museum (see this blog post for more information) and I humbly displayed all the sinological knowledge that is still stored in my head.\n\n\n\nPalace Museum\n\n\n\n\n\nJade cup used by the Qianlong emperor\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the long face?\n\n\nFun times, but even conferences have to come to an end. Or maybe especially conferences have to come to an end. Anyway, the next day there was a post-conference talk by Prof. Geeraerts on clothing terms (again…) and onomasiological salience and entrenchment, which was very interesting. Here is a picture of him talking with my Japanese friend Saito. This was followed by a lunch and that was that; but it’s not that for this update!\n\n\n\nTalking with Saito\n\n\n\n\nIsCLL 15 (2016, National Hsinchu University of Education)\nLast weekend I went to the International Symposium on Chinese Languages and Linguistics, which was held in Hsinchu. It was very interesting, with highlights on the first day in the second session.\n\n\n\nHshinchu University of Education\n\n\n\n\n\nIsCLL\n\n\nBut of course, the real attractions were keynote speakers Randy LaPolla, a big name in Asian linguistics, and Adele Goldberg, one of the big names in Construction Grammar.\n\n\n\nMe and Adele Goldberg\n\n\nApart from these two, it was a good opportunity to network and I made new friends, e.g. three graduate students; with two of them I went to a bar with Belgian beer later. I also bumped into some big names in Formosan linguistics (the native languages of Taiwan): Elisabeth Zeitoun and fellow Belgian Rik De Busser.\n\nSo that was it for this update, which ends considerably on a happier note than the previous one. I hope to see you next time my dear reading friends!"

    "text": "Summer is almost over and I know you must have been dying to read an update on this blog! Or maybe not, but you’re still reading this, so welcome dear reader. In this update I will mostly talk about my adventures in July, but will do a quick recap of what happened after the previous post, which detailed the lovely experience I had doing fieldwork on Bunun.\n\nEnd of the semester\nSo the last weeks of the spring semester 2016 were filled with making presentations and writing papers. All in all, I had to write three of those. So for the fieldwork class I wrote about Nominalization in Isbukun Bunun; for Language and Culture I wrote about the Eurovision Song Contest; and for our seminar I redrafted my paper for the CLDC conference, which I wrote about here. There are some pretty exciting plans for the latter, but I won’t spill any beans until they are confirmed :).\n\n\nGetting home\nIn the beginning of July I flew back home. It was a hell of flight. My airplane between Taipei and Beijing (I flew with Hainan Airlines) was delayed due to ‘bad weather’, which meant I sure as hell wasn’t going to make my flight from Beijing to Brussels. Stranded in Beijing with an American guy who didn’t speak Chinese and was bound for Poland and a Chinese guy who didn’t speak English, I had not only try to find an acceptable alternative for myself, but also for him. Eventually, the Chinese guy used Wechat to book us on flights to Berlin, where I had to change to one to Brussels. I was stressed out and I spent most of the flight semi-sleeping. Eventually I did manage to get to Belgium, where I was greeted by my mother, but not at the gate; instead she (and all the other welcoming committees) were kept from entering the airport, Belgium still being under terror level 3 after the attack on the airport in March.\n\n\nLeiden\nI first had a few days in Belgium, while I was interviewed by MO magazine, about a precious piece of clothing. It was my friend Ellen who did the interviewing, so thank you for that :) The article can be found here.\n\n\n\nCanal in Leiden\n\n\nThen I went to my Summer School on Chinese and Digital Humanities, organized by Leiden University (in the Netherlands). I was a bit nervous, as is always the case when you will be dropped in a group of people you don’t know. Fortunately, there was at least one person I knew, Chen Yanrong, who is doing her Ph.D. on Christians in China at my alma mater and is making a database about that. It turns out Leiden is not a shabby city at all — not that I thought it was before going there. Of course there are windmills, two to be precise.\n\n\n\nWindmill in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nWindmill in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nKU Leuven present\n\n\n\n\n\nWaterview in Leiden\n\n\nThe sessions themselves were also very interesting, ranging from practical advice on how to write proposals, data management and legal questions about data sharing to the more ‘new’ stuff: intros to text mark-up, text mining, database design, spatial analysis, network analysis etc. I did get the feeling that most of the summer school was oriented at historical research than linguistic but there were some German ‘pure’ linguists there nonetheless. Those who have me on facebook or twitter (@simazhi) must have noticed the twitter storm marked by the hashtag #CHDH16, coming from someone who doesn’t tweet often (enough??). However, since this was a conference on digital humanities, I felt it was very appropriate to do so this time.\nSo, what did I get out of the conference? Quite a lot actually. Apart from meeting new researchers and thus establishing a better network (guanxi people!), I got to learn about what is buzzing in the digital sinological academic world. The best for this display of research was at the obligatory poster sessions every evening, an event I had feared but had prepared for back in Taiwan with the help of my professor, classmates, as well as my designing wizard friend Lucio Lu. He convinced that powerpoint was not a designing tool, and my friends, especially of my student organisation Eoos, must know that I am a big fan of powerpoint as the go-to tool for almost everything; so convincing me that there are better tools is not easy. Well, I mean, I know there are better tools, but I mean tools for the layman. Anyway, I asked him to help me make the poster and this is what we came up with:\n\n\n\nPoster up\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster down\n\n\nI am rather happy with the result, it catches the eye well enough and also is not too cluttered with text. I also think that posters serve as an intro to your work, rather than a full paper. Feel free to ask me about it next time you see it :).\nThe second thing I learned at the summer school was that I did need a new approach to my work. No longer do I think excel files are the best way to store my data. TBH, I didn’t think it was before, but I didn’t know how to improve it. Thus came the introduction to relational databases by Michael Fuller, who together with Peter Bol form a team of Harvard professors that work on a database with biographical data: the China Biographical Database (CBDB). This is a wealth of information that makes it possible to investigate different relations between people. It comes in an Access format, as well as an SQLite version. And at Leiden University they have made a Mac dictionary based on the CBDB for easy reference. I decided to turn my data gathered so far in a relational database. Since I am a big fan of open source software (and well, Access is not accessible (pun intended) on Mac – seriously, Microsoft, do something about this) I decided to give Libreoffice Base a chance. Currently I am still in the process of migrating the data, but I think this will eventually lead to a more efficient use of my data (note: there seems to be an extension in Excel called Powerpivot, but the durability and the un-open-sourceness bugs me). I am planning to do an update about this in a future post. Anyway, here are pictures of me doing my presentation:\n\n\n\nMe and my poster\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my poster\n\n\nThe third thing I learnt in Leiden is some applications of data, but more importantly an application for data: Hilde De Weerdt from Leiden University and her team have developed MARKUS, which is an annotation tool for texts. I think this is a very useful tool for me, because it will allow me to spot ideophones in texts, mark them and add them to the aforementioned database. This will allow for an even better analysis and well, better research.\nApart from the conference we of course did some sightseeing, notably the famous library of the Sinological Institute, which houses the biggest library on China in the low countries.\n\n\n\n2016-08-30_05-20-57\n\n\nThere’s also a nice museum of peoples all around the globe, the Volkenkunde Museum (the ‘the’ as article sounds really weird if you know the word is neutral in Dutch).\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\n\n\n\nMuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden\n\n\nSo, after a turbulent journey back home I had a really nice stay in Leiden. Stay tuned, because Berlin is coming up!"

    "text": "Museuminsel\nThe next day was much better, I had to register for my International Symposium of Ancient Chinese Grammar (ISACG 9) in the late afternoon so I decided to do some museum hopping. Being unable to enjoy the full benefit of the 3-day museum pass I chose to tackle the Museum Island (Museuminsel), a collection of five museums that hold some nice treasures. I first went to the Bode Museum, which houses a medievalish collection.\n\n\nAfter that I walked to the Neues Museum (New Museum) because I had heard they have the head of Nefertiti over there. They did and it was wonderful. I think I stayed for at least fifteen minutes just staring at that royal head — you’re not allowed to take pictures of it and there are three guards near it so I just wanted to let this moment soak in. Did you know, when I was little I wanted to become an Egyptologist when I was older. It’s funny that I chose another area to work on now, but the fascination with Egypt and especially Egyptian mythology remains.\n\nIn the pictures you can see me and my bro Heinrich Schliemann, the one who discovered Troy; a small statue of Sekhmet, the lion-headed goddess of war; canopic jars to put organs in during the mummification process; the Egyptian god Thoth, the ibis-headed god of writing; a bas-relief of monotheistic pharaohs Akhenaten (Echnaton) and Nefertiti.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this I went to the Pergamom Museum, which unfortunately is under construction; ironically the Pergamum wing cannot be visited at this time. However, I did see the glorious lapis lazuli gate of Ishtar, originally excavated in Babylon. Oh My Ishtar, it was so beautiful. It was hard to believe how the colour could stay so beautiful after al this time. I think I stood in awe for half an hour; the guards were looking at me suspiciously but I just wanted to let this sink in.\n\n\n\nNext I paid a visit to the Alte Nationalgalerie, a collection of paintings and a few sculptures. Here are some that I thought were cool:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we come to the last museum I visited that day. If it was exhausting for you to read this, imagine how much more it was for me, who spent the whole day there! The last museum is the Altes Museum, which houses the classical collection. I got to see some really famous sculptures, as well as take some nifty pictures with some of them. This often took many attempts."

    "text": "ISACG 9\nNow, off to more serious matters. I had become more comfortable in Berlin by this daylit exploration of the Museum Island, which also happened to be situated very closely to the university where the symposium was to be held. So the next day the symposium started, in a beautiful room of Humboldt Universität zu Berlin (when I asked people where the other Humboldt Universitäte happened to be, they didn’t get my joke. I hope it is funny anyway).\n\nThe symposium was organized mainly by the lovely Barbara Meisterernst, an expert on Han-dynasty (and before and after) verbal aspect. One of the reasons I really wanted to come here was that in a point in the past (about one and a half year ago) I had become interested in her work and mailed her about possible PhD positions. The answer was negative at the time but she did come across as a really caring person, which also showed in the organization of the symposium.\n\nMost of the attendants of the symposium were Chinese or Taiwanese professors. I felt there was a tendency to use very formal ways to solve linguistic problems but there were also a few nuggets of functional-cognitive insights that really struck with me. And, apart from that, I felt really happy to get to know these people, as it shows research on Premodern Chinese is far from dead. One lesser point was meeting the person whose book I used to write my bachelor paper. I guess some idols can lose their pedestal.\nWhen it was my turn to do my presentation, my audience wasn’t super big. It didn’t come as a big surprise, since the parallel session had big names like Alain Peyraube as the chair and the aforementioned pedestal loser as a speaker. I had, however, a really friendly chair Lien Chinfa 連金發. And given that the speaker right before me didn’t show up, I still had a decent audience of really interested people.\nSo I did my presentation on “Ideophones in Old Chinese: The case of the Shijing 詩經” and got some useful comments, for which I would like to thank my audience should they be reading this.\n\nThe symposium was ended with a dinner that brought us closer together in a more informal setting. I was happy because most of the young kids (those -30 year olds) got to sit together, and afterwards we discovered a nice beer place. Denying my Belgian heritage, I drank mojito and discussed events of the conference and other stories with a few people until the bar closed."

So I first went to East Side Gallery, a 1.3 km stretch of Berlin Wall that has been graffitied and acts as a monument of freedom. Below is a picture of me and the most iconic painting, the Bruderkuss (Fraternal kiss), a.k.b. its real name My God, Help Me to Survive this Deadly Love (German: Mein Gott, hilf mir, diese tödliche Liebe zu überleben; Russian: «Господи! Помоги мне выжить среди этой смертной любви»).\n\nNext I explored the land that lay beyond the Museuminsel. The Dom of Berlin and also the very cool Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall).\n\n\nAfter this I took the S-Bahn (I have become an S/U-Bahn expert in this small week; no longer do I need the sentence “Ich weiße es nicht, ich bin auch ein Turist”) to the Bundestag, f.k.a. the Reichstag. This is where the German parliament holds meetings. You can visit the dome if you make an appointment on time. Unfortunately, my schema was heavily restricted by the conference and there were some restoration works in progress. Nevertheless, I made an appointment to go and remembered about it five minutes before I had to be there, when I was in my bed the first day… Maybe another time then ha.\n\nAnd lastly I went to see the darker side of Berlin with that stuff that happened in the 1930s and 1940s. I saw the former HQ of the Gestapo and also the monument to the Jews. It made me silent.\n\n\nI had a bit of a transformational experience in Berlin. At first I didn’t really like the city, but through seeing things, meeting people, going places I slowly began to appreciate it and I know I will go there again in the future, because there is still so much left unexplored. A pleased man, I went back home — once again in a normal plane and not Tintin’s rocket."

And I even got to experience being a teenager again too! In my hometown there is this yearly event — well there are several yearly events like the Flowerparade (Bloemencorso - check this out), the bike race (leave Loenhout as fast as possible to avoid hitting drunk people on the 2 main streets), the yearly shooting at the chapel (don’t know why they do this but it involves a marching band). Anyway, the event I’m talking about is the (in)famous Beachweekend. I need to explain this a little bit. Imagine, you live in a semi-rural area (in Chinese I could say I’m from nongcun 農村 ‘countryside’, but it’s not as far removed from civilization as that term would suggest; in Dutch I live in a boerengat ‘farmer’s ass’ [農夫屁股]). So, what teenagers growing up do for fun is hold ‘tent parties’, which are, as the name suggest, parties held in tents. The size is usually expressed by how many tentpoles there are; kind of like how Japanese people express the room size by referring how many tatami 畳 fit in it. If I remember correctly, three tentpoles is already a decent number. These tent parties are usually held weekly or biweekly in a different patch of meadow, and are visited by huge crowds of youngsters. Now, we come to the main point: Beachweekend. Beachweekend is special. It’s not like I visited this festival so many times, but it still holds a special place in my heart, so I feel I can talk about it. Imagine a large patch of meadow, usually somewhere in the middle of nowhere-ish. This is covered by sand. A lot of sand. In 2015 about 800 tons of sand. This makes the grass look like a beach. I see you get where the event got its name from, and I bet you can guess how long it lasts, too. Add a few tents with booze, a stage where you can see a computer at work and one or two humans who pretend to be musicians (see also the Belgian festival of Tomorrowland) and 15,000 people in total and you can build a party right?"

These are a treasure trove of information and especially in the more recent volumes they touch upon East Asian languages. Furthermore, I was also busy with my database thing as shortly mentioned in this blog update. I am still planning to do a dedicated update when the project has a bit more progress.\nIt was then that I discovered Breaking Bad. I don’t know if this tv series was that much of a hype in Belgium as it was in the English speaking world but I did watch 5 seasons (62 episodes) in two weeks. It was a perfect binge watch and I generally don’t miss watching/having a tv in Taiwan, but it was just nice to be home and do exactly that. By the way, I really liked the show. Of course, some episodes were a bit ‘more of the same old thing’ but I get why the actors and the show received all those awards and nominations."

    "text": "Harry Potter\nApart from the hype game Pokemon Go there was another disturbance in the Force: J.K. Rowling released the script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a play she supposedly wrote [people are having doubts]. I know there is better fan fiction out there. Here is my short review of the book on my Goodreads account:\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two by J.K. Rowling\nMy rating: 1 of 5 stars\nI understand this is a play, which is good because another book might not have worked.\nThat being said, I was extremely disappointed with the flat story line and especially flat characters like for example (view spoiler)[Ron (hide spoiler)].\nSurely, if Rowling wants to go the fan-fiction direction, she should be able to find better story writers. It lacks the magic of Harry Potter and that is very unfortunate given that this is a HP styled ‘sequel’.\nSo, is there anything good left in our precious Potterverse? The answer is yes. In Autumn we can look forward to a new movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them, set in America this time. However, there is even better news. There was a Harry Potter exhibition in Brussels and we went there of course. It was really close to Belgium’s Eiffel tower – the Atomium.\n\nIt was not an easy ride — seriously, how hard can it be to mark the way to your parking spots, or announce that one exit of the highway is closed off (I almost had a second car crash) — but we made it. And I got sorted. The animator who did the sorting ceremony thought I would choose the despicable Slytherin (Dutch: Zwadderich, Chinese: Shilaizhelin 史萊哲林) because I was wearing green, but how wrong that Hufflepuff (Dutch: Huffelpuf, Chinese: Hefupafu 赫夫帕夫) woman was. Instead of the popular choice of children, Gryffindor (Dutch: Griffoendor, Chinese: Gelaifenduo 葛來分多), I was chosen [secret: you get to choose yourself] to be in Ravenclaw (Dutch: Ravenklauw, Chinese: Leiwenkelao 雷文克勞), the best house of course. Testimonials to its greatness can be found here, here and here. By the way, I feel the translation of Dutch has been done really well, at least better than for instance the Chinese trans(liter)ation. The Dutch translator really went the extra mile to translate all names with a Dutch speaking target audience in mind while the Chinese just kind of took the easy road.\n\n\n\nNote to future translators in Chinese should they be reading this: we want sound AND meaning based translations, not that “I can make you a tattoo in Chinese with this conversion chart” Chinese transliteration. Best practices include kekou kele 可口可樂 ‘Coca Cola &lt; (lit.) tasty and fun’, naike 耐克 ‘Nike &lt; enduring and persevering’, baoma 寶馬 ‘BMW &lt; precious horse’. Bad practices are for instance: kendeji 肯德基 ‘KFC &lt; agree to a virtuous base [or some gibberish like that]’ which could have been kendeji 啃得雞 ’KFC &lt; nibbling on the chicken that you got [like, literally having an eating verb and chicken its name].\n\n\nOkay, after that nice sorting ceremony you are led past the Hogwarts Express to the main exhibition hall. It is filled to the brim with costumes, artifacts and all other wondrous things of the Potterverse. Below (and above I guess) you can see some pictures of the exhibition. At the end, however, they did the mischievous ‘you have to go through the store to exit’ scam. I don’t want to sound cheap but 40 euros for a plastic wand of middlefinger size is a bit much no? Or 96 euros for a not-so-fitting black Hogwarts school uniform? Still, we felt like we couldn’t leave empty handed so we bought some candy (like 10 euros), a Dobby mug because “Dobby is a free elf” (15 euros) and I also bought a Ravenclaw scarf for, you know, when it gets cold on the tropical island of Taiwan."

    "text": "Byebye Belgium\nThe last two to three weeks were filled with goodbyes, first and foremost from my paternal grandfather; second and almost foremost from all my friends and family. It all went by so quickly and I want to thank everyone for the nice moments we had. I will miss you again, but then again, I’m only half a day away, so please come visit mee too. To use the words of Mr. Mayor, a major character in the children’s soap Samson and Gert — a show about a now middle-aged man who has a talking dog, a gay hairdresser, a 40-year old man living with his mother, a Belgian fries vendor and a mayor whose main job is putting miniature planes together while his meddling assistent messes up most tasks:\n\nAan allen die gekomen zijn, proficiat! Aan allen die niet gekomen zijn, ook proficiat! (Congratulations to those who came! Furthermore, also congratulations to those who didn’t.)\n\nI’m sure that I will have a chance to meet the ones I didn’t get around to see this time again in the future. Anyway, here are two goodbye pictures.\n\n\nAfter this it was time to take the plane back to Taiwan. I was ‘waved out’ by my dear friend Lai Man and then I just took the plane like it was a busride. Things went so much smoother this time (instead of last time when I was travelling for 30 hours). My phone remembered the internet in Beijing, I managed not to go into China this time but stay inside the airport — should you be travelling through Beijing, they hide the transit gate very well, but know that it is there! And I even got to see this city from above. Bonus points for whoever can tell me which city it is [comment here or on facebook!]."

    "text": "Whoa! Has it been a long time since I last did an update here (and the irony of this sentence is that I wrote it almost two months ago but never got around to finishing this update — that’s the whole final quarter of 2016). That one ended with me coming back to Taiwan and how I spent my third first weeks here. Okay, so what happened in the meantime, you may wonder. In the next period of time (trying to be as vague here as possible).\n\nCourses at NTU\nConcerning my Taida (NTU) life, I took up three courses this semester:\n\nthe Seminar on Language and Culture (yuyan yu wenhua zhuanti 語言與文化專題研究). This is the same group meeting as I had last two semester and is the most vital class. From the very first class it became apparent that we’ve had an increase in students — two new Ph.D. students and three MA students, which is beneficial to the discussions I think, since we are all focusing on different fields, e.g. premodern Chinese, Mongolian, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, politics…\nLinguistics in Manga and Animation (dongman yuyanxue 動漫語言學). This is an interesting course. While the name may not sound super serious, it is nice to see a set of theoretical concepts applied to a field to see whether they hold. The main foci of this course are Naruto and One Piece, which are studied mostly in the original language, i.e. Japanese. And Japanese and comics seem to be a match made in heaven for ideophones (words like onomatopoeia). No doubt you’ve also seen comics of Batman hitting Robin while a “BAM” appears next to him, or a similar word, that expresses this. Well, Japanese does this, but just more. So much more. So very very very very much more.\nManchu 滿文. Yes, the Manchu of the Manchus in Manchuria. This has been a small interest of me for a long time, ever since I did my master of Sinology in 2013-14. I remember, back then, one day we were given a small grammar overview, and a week later we had a first introduction. At the end of the seminar back-then-current-doctor-in-Sinology Mario Cams ended the seminar with an assignment: “Hey guys, you have to translate this handwritten Manchu by next week.” Naturally, we couldn’t. In fact, it took a whole semester to really get into the Manchu alphabet (or syllabary #controversions). But in the end I did get the hang of it I think. I may even take up Manchu II next semester.\n\nHere are some pictures to give you an impression of what the script looks like. The first picture shows our general assignments (my input in this one is not 100% correct by the way): we were given some sentences and then had to transcribe to the Latin alphabet, look it up in our superadvanced Manchu-Japanese dictionary dating from from the quite years, gloss it in Chinese and then translate to a normal Chinese sentence.\n\nThe second picture just says the most Frequently Asked Question about language translation, after the standard set of introductions, namely, how to translate “I love you”. Well, in Manchu it seems to be bi simbe hairambi （I you.ACCUSATIVE love）.\n\n\n\nAutumn holidays\nSomewhere in the beginning of the semester or the end of the summer vacation, I was visited by Katrin (from Switzer-Thailand and most notably from Suzhou (cf. almost all my blog posts in the year 2012-2013). And since she hadn’t finished her more-than-a-year-long Asia trip yet and would soon be findable in Thailand, I was invited over there, and, I mean, who could refuse such an offer. So I went to Phuket.\n\nThe dates were planned around 15th of October, so that’s when I took the plane and had an excellent nocturnal transfer in Singapore’s Changi airport (maybe my best lay-over so far, although Dubai is hard to beat). So eventually I arrived in Thailand, where Katrin and her aunt picked me up and drove us in the back of the jeeplike vehicle to their home, after a small pitstop, where Katrin and I tried on funny Halloween outfits.\n\n\n\nThe house turned out to have a very nice pool, but that’s of course not what Phuket is most famous for; tropical beaches is what comes to mind when you think of that place. I didn’t come in the best season, actually a few weeks before the high-season, so I did not have the typical blue waves and see-through water that entices people to go there year after year, but fortunately it did mean that there were not as many tourists either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Food\nNext I should talk about the food. The food. The food. It was amazing! Being an ardent fan of the Thai alma back in Leuven, I now got the chance to eat real pad thai (picture 1), but also local cuisine as was made by Katrin’s cousin kopun (whom I called kapoen), more pad thai in a roadside restaurant, dinner made by the aunt. In short, if you want good food, Phuket is a nice place to go.\n\n\n\n\nFantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them\nFantastical beasts and where to find them, next to being an amazing movie worthy of the potterverse (unlike that Screenplay That Should Not Be Named which couldn’t even pass for bad fanfiction), is a title that could equally apply to Thailand. Katrin casually informed me that Phuket was the home address of a plethora of dangerous snakes, spiders, centipedes and scorpions and that all occurred around the house. On two days we found two black scorpions that had drowned in our marvelous pool. Luckily, though unfortunate for them, scorpions cannot swim. There was also the spider on the wall in my room. Here are pictures.\n\n\n\n\n\nTouring the Island\nThe next day Kapoen en Katrin took me around the island. We went into the mountains where monkeys have their monkey place to await tourists and beg for food. They are pretty cheeky, funky monkeys.\n\n\nThen we also went to a temple, the Wat Chalong temple to be precise. Lots of gold. While it is Buddhist, you do notice that it’s a different Buddhism than the one we have in Chinese culture. Also, when you pray and you get a bad fortune, you can casually leave behind your bad fortune by binding it to a holy tree in the temple domain — a custom that originated in Japan according to my guides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKapoen then also took us further around the island, to see all the tourist spots. We have views where Chinese people come take their wedding pictures, a Muay Thai gym (without any cool people though :( ).\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we also got roti, a pancake like dessert which was heavenly. And we passed by Katrin’s aunt (one of the many many aunts) that was selling eggs at the market.\n\n\nAnd thus ended my Autumn Break in Thailand. Next stop, Shanghai! 耶✌️～～～～"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hi folks! So mid-October during my self-imposed Autumn break I first went to Thailand (read about it here). I forgot to tell you the whole story about their recently deceased king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, so I will add that here first. The rest of the post will be concerned with my travels to Mainland China to visit my friend Guillermo in Shanghai and Suzhou.\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej\nThis King, who reigned actually as Rama IX from 1946 until 2016 (that’s 70 years — we are speaking Queen Elisabeth II terms here, although she is only the 43th place on the list of longest reigning monarchs, Bhumibol is number 17). The king was loved by his people. And I don’t blame them; amidst all the turmoil Thailand went through in the last 100 years, having a symbol like a king serve as a constant must have provided some constant comfort during this time. As a side note, I do think I find myself being a fan of a monarchy (Belgium is also a Kingdom), although I should make some remarks: 1) Some of my friends have probably heard me express that I wish we were part of an empire, because I think it has a ring of grandeur. I’d rather be Empire of Belgium than Kingdom of Belgium, although I wouldn’t want any of the side effects one of neighbouring countries had when they tried to establish one roughly 70 years ago in their third attempt. 2) While I’m generally in favour of a symbolic role for a monarch, and can agree that they should get some public money, I do not think this should be very extensive for his kin. As for Belgium, this is an ongoing issue. 3) Why I am against a president as head of state, e.g. current president in office of the US Donald Drumpf.\nSo to return to my original story (thank you for bearing with me, pictures will follow soon), I was in Thailand where I found myself in a mourning country. Everywhere was the head of Rama IX / Bhumibol. Later I was explained I was in the Yellow zone which is considerably royalist and nationalist; contrasted against the Red zone (near Bangkok). And now will come the pictures that this story has been leading up to. Next to Kapoen’s family restaurant there was another vendor whose stall had been completely destroyed because he had denounced the deceased king on facebook, apparently questioning “why we still have a king, is this not a backward thing?”. His place was trashed.\n\n\n\n\nShanghai\nMoving on, I went to Shanghai on the recently extended transit visa (from 72 hours (3 days) to 144 days (6 days)). Luckily they let me in and I made my way to Tongji University 同济大学 where I was greeted by my friend Guillermo, who studied at NTU (Taiwan Daxue 臺灣大學) last year as an exchange student. I have written about him before (in this post where you can also see him dancing with a masked suit on). Here is a selfie of the two of us:\n\nSo what else did I do in Shanghai? I went to the excellent Shanghai Museum 上海博物馆, where I had been to twice before (see here for instance). As the weather had decided not to cooperate I was so so so wet. In Dutch we would say kletsnat, in Chinese linshi 淋湿.\n\nI love the masks in that museum, so here is an impression:\n\n\n\nThey also had some pretty cool paintings by Ren Xiong 任熊 (Qing, 1823-1857), who clearly painted in a style that is evocative of manga. I took pics, so you get pics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we also saw some paintings of flowers juxtaposed with a nice calligraphed text, a cool painting of a branch with a circle and text and stamps (never forget the stamps!), and the bronze bells, that Guille loves. He even gave me a miniature version of them that he had bought on the fake market.\n\n\n\nI went there alone because Guille had a lot of architectural stuff to do. So when I got back to his dorm, the dorm had been transformed in a Spanish architectural taskforce groupwork unit. Friendly people, although I do not know if they liked me jokingly asking about the difference between their software and The Sims. Haha. Also, the question must be asked, why are virtually all Spanish people I meet architects? Do Spanish universities offer other majors?\n\nLater we also went to a meeting of Flemish people in Shanghai, organized by the VLIS (Vlamingen in Shanghai (Flemish in Shanghai)). I made myself a member at a reduced price with my negotiation skills and got cheaper beer for my friends and myself. I met my dear friend Yoana who studied Sinology with me and was in Nanjing when I was in China), although I apparently took no picture with her, so you’ll have to make do with pictures of me and Guillermo, again.\n\n\nBut I also met my xuedi 学弟 Hsuan’s girlfriend and his classmate Paulien. We went to KTV (karaoke) together. I wish Taiwan would have as many Western songs as this Shanghainese KTV did. Before that we had dinner and they gave Hsuan beer in a milk tea cup. See below.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzhou\nNext stop on my travels was Suzhou. Ah wonderful Suzhou.\n\n上有天堂，下有苏杭。 Shang you tiantang, xia you Su-Hang Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hanghzou\n\nI studied there in 2012-2013, so if you are interested, you can reread my blogposts about it (click the tag on the left in the tag cloud to get a list of relevant posts). This part is dedicated to my closest friends of then: Joke, Katrin, Youmi, Shengli, Gabriel, Jan (Honza), Misa, Helca, Shanben, Zhuxia… … … (apparently I had many friends)\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd coincidence or not, I saw the ayi 阿姨 of my dorm again. She was so friendly and as photogenic as ever. Did you know that one time she gave me small pearls from Taihu 太湖! She hasn’t grown though.\n\n\n\nAnd that day Guillermo and me also met with one of my dearest taekwondo friends, Daniel. We went to have lunch in my favourite restaurant Yangyang 洋洋 where they have the best gulaorou 咕咾肉. We ordered so much that we just couldn’t finish. But it was worth it!!\n\n\nNext we went on a small city tour, first continuing the campus tour. It was a bit strange, the campus guards (unlike NTU, Suzhou University 苏州大学 is not open to the general public) were being d!cks about letting us in. I guess some people like to abuse the power they are given. On a different note, I bought new shoes because the bad weather in Shanghai had destroyed them. Below is a picture of the bad state they were in.\n\n\n\nOn our city tour we went to Pingjianglu, where I had booked a Qing-dynasty style hostel. The beds were quite hard and there was a guy snoring so loud at night that I woke him up during the night by taking away his pillow. If I don’t get to sleep, you don’t get to sleep. But jokes aside, I wasn’t the only one woken up, I think that about three people couldn’t sleep so that is why I acted. The other people thanked me afterwards haha.\n\n\nThen we also went to the Lion Grove garden, my favourite garden in Suzhou. Here are some pictures that paint the athmosphere:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day I went to Panmen 盘门, one of the few gardens that I hadn’t visited during my year in Suzhou. Joke had been there and our Cambodian friend Sautta had spent the Mid-Autumn Festival over there four years ago (oh my god, has it been four years?????????????) yet I hadn’t been there, “leaving something to come back to”. So I came back. And maybe I was wrong, because it was a beau-ti-ful garden. I took the bus but couldn’t find the entrance though — people had built a hotel between the bus station and the garden. I subsequently went through the hotel, suspicious but nobody stopped me. And yes, there was an entrance. The lady in green (below) belonged to the hotel staff and asked me which room I was in. When I honestly explained that I couldn’t find the entrance she clearly did not know what to do with me. She just said, “Okay, go in”, not being used to this. It was a nice hotel though.\n\nThe garden itself is estimated to be around 2,500 years old. It also harbours the oldest pagoda built in Suzhou (in 247 AD) and it used to be the only entrance (or rather open space) in the city’s wall. I felt it was a quite large garden (though no Humble Administrator’s Garden 拙政园). Or maybe it just felt big because of the small children who were on a field trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext I took a bus back. But it dropped me off at Auchan 欧尚, the big supermarket, so I decided to do some shopping, or window shopping. Never thought I would say this but while I was standing on the rolling carpet that takes you to the upper floors, I kinda teared up. Well, it’s not that I was crying, but it was emotional, because that’s where my year in Suzhou began — buying mattresses. And I never thought that supermarkets could make me feel that way. Also, they still have the cucumber chips. In picture two and three below you can see that I was not happy with that four years ago either.\n\n\n\n\nAnd as a last picture of this update (congratz on finishing), I present to you a picture of the Gate of the Orient 东方之门 (“Gate of the Orange” in Chinglish), a recent landmark bordering the Golden Chicken Lake 金鸡湖 that was not yet finished when I left last time. Now it was. It still looks like a pair of trousers."

I was running in Pudong airport in Shanghai to get my flight because I had to queue for two hours just to get through the security check, but it turned out to be no problem — apparently China occasionally bullies Taiwanese airlines, resulting in a delay of two, three hours. Maybe we should call this a case of sai weng zhi ma 塞翁之馬 “The old man at the border’s horse”. Don’t worry if you don’t understand this Chinese saying; it basically means that bad things can become good things and vice versa. Anyway, the main topic of this blogpost will be my participation in a conference in Japan, at the end of December 2016. So in order to get there, let me first quickly do an overview of the time between my arrival back in Taiwan and before going to Japan."

It also houses some war criminals and has a history museum built next to it that tells a slightly twisted version of events. Here are pictures (also, notice the very cool metal torii gate in the first picture).\n\n\n\nDuring my visit I observed the locals and the way they performed their rituals (washing hands, throwing money, and clapping).

    "text": "A New Year\nAfter my trip to Japan (read more about it here) and my department’s Christmas parties upon my return, and of course upon reaching the end of December, there was the annual New Year’s Celebration. It’s kind of funny because with this even we really get in a cyclical kind of post. That is to say, I wrote about this last year as well. If you want to see beautiful pictures of the big tower Taipei 101 ‘exploding with fireworks’, I strongly suggest you look at my post of last year. This year I spent New Year in a more private setting, far away from the tower. However, I did take a ride on the ferris wheel (note: Dutch reuzenrad ‘giant-s-wheel’) and I had the best macaroni and cheese ever made in Taiwan. A very traditional New Year’s celebration indeed. Here is a summarizing picture. As you can see, the Taipei 101 fireworks from the outskirts of Taipei has an air of nuclear explosions.\n\n\n\nEspaña por favor\nBut, as you may have expected, this post is not only about New Year. Rather, it is about how I spent January and February 2017. Since the autumn semester here in Taiwan ends mid-January, I had about two weeks of final presentations and final papers that kept me up in the first fortnight of the new year. Well that was fun! Especially because near the end of that period I got a visit from my eSpanish amigo Guillermo. Now you may remember that I went to visit him during his exchange in Shanghai, last October. This was the return match. We went to all his favourite places he wanted to go to or that he used to frequent when he was studying here last year. This mostly comes down to having breakfast in a traditional Taiwanese place where they have stuff like doujiang 豆漿 ‘soy milky things’.\n\nWe also went to the Taipei Fine Arts museum (see this post) where there were some crazy exhibitions, in particular this Korean black-and-white movie.\n\n\nAfter that we went to the Martyr’s Shrine 命忠烈祠, a place where they honour the soldiers that fell defending the republic. It looks a lot like Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, especially with the young soldiers performing their military service with a kind of acrobatic change of guard every hour or so.\n\n\n\nOn the day Guillermo was leaving he took me to a museum he had been going to and whose existence I wasn’t really aware of: the Museum of the History and Philology of Academia Sinica 中研院歷史文物陳列館. Academia Sinica 中研院 is a national academy of Taiwan that is quite famous for its research in hard sciences like physics, mathematics etc., but also bio-sciences and humanities, especially in the realms of archeology cum sinology. One of the most famous presidents of the institution (also the first?) was Hu Shi 胡適, an ex-president of Peking University in China and a nominee of the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1939. During my master’s degree in Sinology in Leuven we had to read some his writings, especially about his reinterpretation of Chinese philosophy, which definitely is considered as a standard work in the that field. Fond memories.\nAnyway, what I really wanted to see in the museum were the oracle bones. As you may know, or not, Chinese characters were first written on the belly of turtle shells after the backside had been used in a divination ritual: shamans/priests would take a question from a consulter, carve the question on the turtle shell, throw it in the fire, wait until they heard the cracking and then interpret these patterns as either a positive, negative or undecided answer. They would write down the answer on said turtle shell and may ask the question again if it was really important (like: am I going to get a son, finally, or a 17th daughter? This is exaggerated, but apparently these were real issues for the ancient Chinese nobility). The most interesting for me, however, is that they called this divination ritual bu 「卜」. Now, you may see that the character 卜 itself looks like cracks of the turtle shell (correct), but what comes with that is the pronunciation of Mandarin bù, which used to be more something like pok or puk. Yes, this is a SOUND ideophone (onomatopaeic) word that depicts the sound of cracking of the turtle shell. Neat. Here are oracle bones on turtle shells and also on deer antlers.\n\n\nOther worthwhile stuff in the museum is the Manchu (and other Qing dynasty) scripts that were taken to Taiwan in the 1940s. There is actually much more to see in this museum and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\n\n\n\nBelgian Beijing’ers\nA bit later I got a visit from my friends Lili and Ewoud who are both studying in Beijing. Here we are near Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall and the two of them jumping in the Confucius temple.\n\n\nOther fun moments I had were going to karaoke (KTV) with my department mates, and I can’t not show this picture that shows my dear PhD colleague Chester in full karaoke passion. This is how any good performance should be (and I mean that in all earnestness).\n\nAnd here are three more pictures of me: reading a book written in blood (I forgot where); earthbending in the museum in Keelung where I went with my Japanese friend Saito, his wife and my Keelung Klassmate Mergen; and posing in front of some Chinese art.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Tainan family\nOne of the most memorable trips during this winter break was my trip to my Tainanese 台南 classmates. Ask any person from Tainan and they will tell you that Tainan is the real capital of Taiwan or the real Taiwan, where life passes slower, especially in comparison to the ‘City of Dragons’, a.k.a. Taipei. And thus I found myself with Taipeiese classmate April boarding the HSR on a Saturday morning in February. We were greeted by Taco, Hanna, Nick and Craig in Taipei. I had an amazing trip. I had been to Tainan before, in the summer of 2014, but these visits are always better if you have a guide, and I had four. What I wanted to visit (again) was the Confucius temple, so that’s where they took us first. Of course we jumped there as well.\n\n\nAnd in the back there is this massive rendition of the opening paragraph of the Great Learning (Daxue 大學), one of the four books canonized in the Chinese intellectual tradition. This opening paragraph was one of the things we had to learn by heart in the second year for Classical Chinese and it’s buried pretty deep in mine, up to the point I can still recite it and used part of it in my acceptance speech of my scholarship last year. Here is a swag picture.\n\nAlso for that same course we had to make a diagram or schema that summarized the key concepts of that text. I decided to go for a Chinese landscape inspired diagram, infused with the Taipei 101 and the Chinese pavilion used in the World Exhibition in Shanghai. Should you want to know more, just ask :)\n\nOther things we saw in Tainan were the Koxinga-related temple and an exhibition on Taoism next to it. God I love these Taoist diagrams.\n\n\n\nNow, things I hadn’t seen last time (because I did not know where they were) were Fort Zeelandia (Anping gu bao 安平古堡), a Dutch fortress built with a mortar consisting of a mixture of sugar, sand, ground seashells and glutinous rice. Those Hollanders really can use anything to build. No windmills in Tainan though.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext to it is a small museum for a famous calligrapher. We displayed our water calligraphy skills.\n\nAnd a bit further is the Anping Treehouse, a complex of walls (previously with roofs?) that is overrun by roots of trees. A supercool place. I will use pictures to express my sentiments.\n\n\n\n\nNow, to wrap up this post, I should mention we went to the Museum of Literature, where they have a book of our department’s professor Chiang 江: Nanren de rutou 男人的乳頭 “The Nipples of Men”. Must be an interesting read. Here is what the museum looks like from the outside.\n\nAnd finally, two family pictures I took with my super warm Taiwanese family (except for two daughters who left for Taipei a bit earlier). Thank you guys for the great trip!\n\n\nNow can someone please help me get out of this tree?"

    "text": "After last update’s adventures in Tainan during the winter holidays, a new semester began. With the courses I am taking this semester I will have fulfilled the credit requirement of my study here. It is strange to think that a portion of my journey here will also have ended when this semester is over (although I do not plan to take on quitting taking some courses, but maybe just purely out of interest rather than necessity). That being said, let me take you back to those last weeks of February 2017. As the first week ended, another deadline came up for a conference on Iconicity in language I now know I will be attending in the summer in Nijmegen in the Netherlands. Probably more on that in another post. But as I was pressing that submitting button, I was also readying myself for the adventurous week that lay ahead: a visit from some of my closest friends from Belgium. This post has got to have a title, and thus I chose the punning “Notorious B.I.T.”, B.I.T. of course standing for ‘Belgians in Taiwan’. With that out of the way, let’s start!\n\nSaturday - Arrival in Taiwan\nWhen Isabelle, Cedric and Ruben arrived in Taiwan on Saturday, they were tired, because they had of course been travelling since the day before, but I could also see that they were excited, and I was slightly nervous to let them experience the best Taipei had to offer in a week, although I tried my best to hide these emotions. Here is how I found the boys:\n\nSo we took the bus to Taipei, which gave us a chance to catch up and I couldn’t help but notice that it felt so nice to just be able to speak my own language with other people here in Taiwan. It’s not that I don’t know any other Belgians (or Flemish people for that matter) here but it’s still different to talk with people you have known for a long time and who maybe deserve the title of old friends without being old (ha, reflect on that for a while readers). So yeah, we went to check them in in their hotel, pick up the lovely Singaporean Huiying, who is an old friend of Cedric’s and then my dearest CJ and then go for ramen. Now, this is not any ramen, this is the best ramen in town. Once I stood two hours in line just to get it. It was pretty late when we got there but eventually we managed to get in — only to find out the special was sold out. It took a lot of negotiating in Chinese on my part to convince them of how much I wanted my friends and me to eat this special dish and eventually we all managed to do so. Victory.\n\nNext I took them around my campus for an evening stroll, but they were pretty tired so we said goodbye for the night and met up the next day.\n\n\nSunday - Museum day\nOn Sunday we visited Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall and the surrounding scenery (see many posts on this blog) and then went to the Presidential Palace, followed by a trip to the National Palace Museum, where we roamed for a few hours and I gave them my guided tour of the place.\n\n\nThis was preceded by eating dumplings at Bafang yunji 八方雲集, a chain of dumplings that you can find almost anywhere in Taipei, and followed by drinking coffee outside of the MRT. Later we stopped by the Confucius temple and the Bao’an Gong next door. Here is a (failed) jumping picture:\n\n\nDinner that night was sushi.\n\n\nMonday - Wulai\nThe day after we set out to Wulai 烏來, a mountainous village in New Taipei City where they have hot springs and a waterfall. The weather didn’t fully agree with us, but we managed to cross a nice bridge, walk past the hot springs to get a good look around, have lunch in Wulai, walk to a waterfall for some pictures, walk back and let our feet soak in the hot water, accompanied by doctor Ruben’s critique of everybody’s feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, after a lot of queuing and standing on the bus, we were tired and had to take a nap. This was followed by drinks in Ximen.\n\n\n\n\nTuesday - Walking tour\nWe begin Tuesday with a brisk trip on the MRT system towards Taipei 101. Isabelle sure found her spot in the MRT, while the men were watching the gate.\n\n\nSo then we had lunch at Din Tai Fung, in the basement of 101. Next, we did Sun Yat-Sen and then went over to Gongguan: coffee break and a visit to my place. After that, bookworms Cedric and Hui-Ying spent time in a second-hand bookshop of which I became a member recently; I mean, how could you not after such a good rating from these book critics?? Then it was time to say goodbye to Huiying. We had hot pot for dinner. Ruben gave it a ‘tien op tien’, as he had been doing every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday - Off to Hualien\nThe very next day we took a train to Hualien, in order to see Taroko. The overexcited staff of the superb Sleeping Boot Backpacker Hostel gave us a kind-of unclear map with food locations of the neighbourhood so we decided to go exploring. We had some kind of exploding egg thing of which we forgot to take pictures, but it was cool. And messy. Also, we left a message for our Dutch friends:\n\nThen we walked to the coastline, where I was almost swallowed by the ocean, had some nightmarket goodies and saw an aboriginal dance show. The indigenous people of Hualien are mostly Amis 阿美, which incidentally is the language they are studying now for the fieldwork class this year (see my adventures in Bunun land last year). Here are some pictures of their performance. Lots of twirling and whirling and swirling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday - Taroko\nTaroko, named after the Truku 太魯閣 aboriginals, is one of the tourist spots that is mentioned in all travel guides of Taiwan. I had been wanting to go there before, and I got as far as Hualien in the summer of 2014, but there had just been a tyfoon and they were cleaning a week later so back then I didn’t get in. Now, in 2017, it was a whole different game. Below are picturesque pictures of our trip in the national park. All I can say is I will be back in the future. But first, a picture of us sleeping in the early morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter lunch and the exploration of the pagoda and Buddhist temple (see pics above) at the Tianhsiang 天祥 village deep in the mountains, we wanted to continue to the furthest spot in the park. But we came down and found policemen frantically pointing towards the side of the road. The restaurants were closed. Even the 711, you know, the convenient store that never closes, was pulling down its blinds. I was very confused, as were the other Belgians, as we were hustled to the back of the (again) closed 711. It turns out there was some kind of secret military exercise, so I was expecting to see the tanks rolling down the mountains and whatever else the words ‘military exercise’ entail. But no, none of that, just plain old boring waiting for an hour, while watching that the monkey (yes, a real monkey) wouldn’t steal our food. But then, the hour was over and we continued our trek. This is the stuff all those Chinese paintings are made of.\n\n\nAlso, we learnt that Ruben has terrible balance. He kept falling over during the journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater that night we had cake - I introduced them to Taiwan’s 85˚, where we were playing cards. Yes, if there is one keyword of this week, it would probably be manillen, a card game Isabelle has been playing since before she could walk. The way I remember it, her family deals the cards, takes a look and then decides who has won without playing any cards, only to repeat this until one person seemingly has got the highest points so they are the winner. My game strategy is known as loose cannon, because Isabelle kept “introducing” (read: making up) rules as we were playing. Still, it provided for wonderful bonding times. manillen manillen manillen!\n\n\n\n\nFriday - Biking and Jiufen’ing\nOn Friday we checked out and rented bikes for a super short mini bike ride on the coastline of Hualien.\n\n\n\n\nAfter our bike rush, we swooshed back to the hostel, grabbed our luggage and made our way to the station. In Ruifang 瑞芳 we got out and took a taxi to Jiufen 九份, the number one visit spot for Japanese and Koreans to Taiwan. Up the mountain we went.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday - Taipei and Tamsui\nThe last day was spent with a walk in the park - botanical garden of Taipei, some coffee drinking and lunch eating where we were joined again by CJ.\n\n\n\n\nAnd then we had a trip to Tamsui 淡水, where we did most sightseeing places, like the Red Fortress, the White House, the Mackay church, Alethia University with the Oxford building (made with real red bricks!!!), though not Tamsui high school, which after an incident last year apparently is kind of closed off for the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some Korean barbecue it was time to send them home - I had a really nice time with my friends. Tien op tien. I gave them a farewell huggy and a farewell Chunky, a Kitkat bar which obviously has been named after Chunky Kaishek, before I put them on the bus to the airport. Thank you. Come again."

The first one was “logical analysis of language” (yuyan de luoji fenxi 語言的邏輯分析), in which Prof. Hsieh posed the challenge to think about linguistic problems based on small data sets that had been slightly simplified. The course was conducted in relation to the preselections of Taiwan’s participant of the International Linguistics Olympiad. In general I think it gave a nice overview of the basic components of linguistic theories, as well as some reflection on the nature of language. There was also some conlang-inspired coursework. For instance, here you see me and my group mate Nick having a conversation in a made-up sign language. At the time it was only a few days old so it’s more pidginy than creoly in nature, but we managed to communicate. Subtitles provided!"

I may have found a source of material that will help me to answer one of the questions I have been interested in all along: how did ideophones develop diachronically in Chinese? Without going into too much detail, for this paper I was concerned about the methodology, from a technical perspective. The question most researchers are grappling with (or should be) is the source of their data (I am using historical texts), and how to transform raw material into analyzable and usable data. For the moment, I have devised a float chart that should take my data from raw material to slightly enriched material ready for analaysis. Here’s the chart:\n\nThen the question I asked, related to ideophones, was what patterns would emerge from the data. I noticed an interesting phenomenon of post-ideophone markers, which I will follow up on later. Without explaining it too much here, I just want to show the figures I used for the analysis or the motivated explanation in terms of Cognitive Grammar — mostly because I am proud of them, ha:\n\n“魯道衰”\n\n“洙泗之間，殷殷如也”\nWhat was also special about this paper is that it was largely written when I was already back at home!"

    "text": "I had a great summer holiday. And with a great summer comes a great hashtag. #travelswithbae seemed to do the job. Thank you readers, for reading, I hope you are up for the many pictures that lie ahead. Below I’ll talk about my time in Prague and Belgium. Ready? Lift off!\n\nPrague\nAfter last update (insert clickbait) we went to see the Prague school of buddies that Joke and I had spent a lot of time in Suzhou with (read, for instance, how we climbed China’s Yellow Mountain together exclusively in this post). So yeah, my Czech Suzhou roommate Jan, Helena and Misa were a big part of the year in China and hopefully will stay close friends for the rest of my life. In 2014, right before I went to Taiwan for a summer school, we went to visit them in Prague and I felt the time had come for a revisit, because Prague is beautiful, as this main view of the Charles Bridge (Karlův most) and Prague castle (Pražský hrad) shows.\n Prague, as we all dream of it\nJan told us that Prague used to be composed of many different “cities of Prague”, as we strolled in Vyšehrad, one such a city on the other side of the castle. This church, which I like better, was at one point the scene for one of Jan’s friends and apparently they played Elvish music from Lord of the Rings while the bride was on her way to the altar.\n\n\n\nThen, next, I should show pictures of the gardens you can visit in Prague. Going from the Senate garden to the Fürstenberg Gardens to some secret garden which was only marked in Czech so only the locals knew about it. It is also where I learned to say ‘two tickets’ for me and CJ in Czech: dva lístky. Notice also the two peacocks casually strutting through the gardens; some are just normal, others are white!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing able to get two tickets was all very nice when you have a Czech person with you to deal with the Czech responses, but not when it’s just the two of you ordering dva lístky for the Jewish graveyard but not being able to understand a single slovo of what the ticket babička is trying to sell to you. Still, the Jewish part of Prague, Josefov, does leave a big impression on most tourists — the ones that are not too busy taking good social media pictures or chatting about their lives. It’s a bit like the Jewish monument in Berlin (see my post last year) where people assume it’s okay to make fun pictures between those stones. It is not. Okay, that’s out of my system. Here are beautiful pictures of the Jewish quarter.\n\n\nOur trip in Prague was a bit short, just four days. It really was a #PraagseVierdaagse. In the remaining time we met up with Helena (thanks for the breakfast), did a blitz visit to Prague castle, saw the turning head of Kafka, thought we were in a French castle, and explored the lovely upcoming neighbourhood Jan lives in called Karlín. Thank you guys for spending time with us and showing us around!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and to round up the part about Prague, here is an upside down Saint Wenceslaus:\n\nAnd before you go to Prague, do not forget to check this youtube channel full of tips and tricks!\n\n\nBelgium\nComing to Belgium with CJ provided me with the opportunity to be a tourist in my own country. Apart from the beautiful landscapes and numerous activities that Loenhout has to offer, it was nice to just be back home and meet up with family and friends. I think I miss them more than before, as more time spent abroad passes. So seeing them makes me happy and I cherished the moments together.\n The fields of Loenhout.\n With the sinology crew and baby Moana!\n Reunion in Antwerp with Tahnee and Barbara\n ’t Steen (the Stone) and Lange Wapper (“Long Wapper”)\nWe also went to Leuven, visiting the old alma mater, exploring the city (CJ has an unhealthy interest in begijnhoven), and of course, eating at De Werf.\n the Church and the City Hall in Leuven\n the Lions of Pauscollege\n Fonske, the Fons Sapientiae. Yet’s it’s a studious boy pouring beer in his brain.\n CJ de Kotmadam\n Faculty of Arts\n\nSee this picture above? I thought they were dementors the first time I saw them. Okay, well, I was drunk on my first night in Leuven but man, those things are scary. And it gets even scarier if you know that the whole Faculty of Arts is built on an old church site. There must be some ghosts still dwelling there and I bet they have many conversations with these two statues. Yuck.\n Artes Library\n East Asian Library. I used to work here as a student.\n Thanks for letting us crash at your place dr. Ruben!\nhay bale\nWe also went to Brugge (Bruges, 布魯日), a city any serious tourist of Belgium cannot fail to neglect. It also has begijnhoven, old towers, is called the Venice of the North and is just old in general. But beautiful.\n water\n Casually performing eye surgery\n Her fingers leave the painting. It’s alive.\n This is a wordplay. “Show off your West-Flemish mug(ke)”. mokke is both a mug and a girl!\n CJ is the frietking of the friet museum and fries are Belgian.\n\nAnd finally, in Belgium, we have Gent (Ghent, 根特) where I finally went to visit my friend Cedric’s PhD office at the University of Ghent. Thanks for the tour of the city!\n Sint-Baafskathedraal\n ’t Gravensteen\n Graffiti street\n Ordering coffee\n CJ drinking coffee (in Prague)\nYes! You made it! We did it!\nNext up is a retelling of a modern British classic, that is to say, our trip to the UK. Hope to see you there!"

    "text": "Howdy cowboys and cowgirls!\nIn this post I’ll talk about the trip I went on to UK this summer, which took place after the events chronicled in last time’s post “Hashtag Travels With Bae”. Since I am of a recycling nature, I wanted to reuse that title, hence this one is called “Travels with bae in UK”. The trip we took was about 10 days long and was a real Journey To the West: we first went to London for a night, then to Oxford, subsequently Bristol with a day trip to Bath, then to Cardiff and then back to London with an excursion to Cambridge. Here is our route on the map:\n\nLondon\nWe took the Eurostar to London from Brussels-Midi (which is called Brussel-Zuid in Dutch — a very confusing nomenclature that must discourage tourists travelling to the Brussels region, if not for other reasons like peeing boys, peeing girls, or a giant building made of balls). It was my first time taking this train and it went really well; I was super surprised by how fast we made it to Lille in France (called Rijsel in Dutch). We arrived in the Pimlico neighbourhood of London where our hostel was situated and where we were to meet up with Joke and Katrin, well-known from my year in Suzhou (read about it on this blog by looking for posts tagged ‘Suzhou’). They were also trekking Westwards the next day, to go walking in Wales; we were eventually going there with some stops along the way. So after a hot night’s sleep (the Spanish guys in our dorm insisted on closing ‘the cold window’ but sleeping in his undies) we went to Paddington station.\n Beartje Paddington\n\n\nOxford\nFrom there we went to Oxford, which for the summer had been transformed into a prospective study tour for six-year-old Chinese children. I suppose the goal was familiarising them with all the different colleges and then somehow motivating them to study really hard to get into them. The children seemed more interested in playing we-chat games with each other on their brand-new iPhones though.\n Group of Chinese tourists peeking inside a college\nI was really excited to go to Oxford, actually, and I think we should have spent more time there than we did. However, we did get to see some really great things. One of these things is the Ashmolean Museum, the world’s first university museum, established in 1683, when I was -308 years old. There are these futuristic dog sculptures guarding the door and inside there are many cool (yet old) things. Here are some pictures.\n The dog\n Manchu writing\n A game set\n Christian hugs (if I remember correctly these are St. Peter and St. Paul, also the saints that the church of Loenhout city is named after)\n Classical statues\nOf course, Oxford is most famous for its university, so we did try to do some ‘college hopping’. We did New College, Trinity and Balliol, among others. There ar two things that you must know about these places. 1) All colleges look very beautiful, but some look more beautiful than others. They all have the same colour as well. 2) There is some whacky pronunciation game going on with them. For instance, Magdalen College is pronounced /ˈmɔːdlɪn/, but that’s not what’s written there; and Balliol is /ˈbeɪliəl/.\n One of them colleges\n Exeter?\n Christ Church college\n Trinity\n Trinity\n Balliol\n Balliol\n Radcliffe Camera. Yes, it was raining.\nApart from the colleges, Oxford is also famous for J.R.R. Tolkien, who used to hang out with his bros in a pub called The Eagle And Child. We went there.\n The Eagle and Child\nAnd semi-related to this: our hostel room was in Lord of the Rings-themed! This may have been the most important reason I wanted to go to Oxford in the first place, as I was semi-obsessed with Tolkien’s universe this summer.\n The Fellowship of the Ring\n Map of Middle Earth\n\n\nBristol\nAfter our trip to Oxford it was time to take the Great Western Railway to Bristol, ever the upcoming city of the UK. I knew nothing about this city and I don’t know if I know much more now. The city needs some time to grow on you but after three days I felt alright with it, though I doubt it will become my favourite place-to-be. As we found out, there is a lot of work in the city, if you’re a bit creative (think graffiti). There is also a lot of unemployment and many homeless people. It took a while to become immune to really kind requests for leftover change, because you want to help them but you know it’s an institutionalised problem that one person can’t change. On to better aspects of the city: the art of street artist Banksy — I couldn’t find a photo to put here ;‑) . But he did make some nice stencils and graffiti throughout Bristol.\n The Mild Mild West\n The Hung lovers\n Death\n Not everything is made by Banksy. This was also beautiful and located behind a church in a city wall!\n\n\nBath\nBristol is the perfect base to do a day trip to Bath, an ancient Roman spa that has been turned into a nice museum. It is worth going there, although the water doesn’t look very attractive. This is because the sunlight promotes the growth of algae in the hot spring (still hot!). This problem could be easily solved if they would put a roof over the baths and I really wish they would, to recreate the Roman experience (I’m not asking them to turn it in a modern spa but in an ancient one). The city itself is very nice to walk through. It reminds me a bit of my time in Brugge (good for a day but will you stay there longer?). That being said, it’s a bit more rural and full of old buildings that do remind you of the historicity of the city, in every corner. There’s also a really great coffee shop, Colonna and Smalls, that CJ took me to where we had a great afternoon coffee break. Bath deserves a visit!\n Bath water\n Golden head\n Some real Roman engineering. This transports the hot water from the holy hot spring to the public baths\n Royal Crescent\n Bath abbey and its lovely gulls\n\n\nCardiff\nAfter Bristolling and taking a Bath we ventured even more to the West, to the capital of Wales: Cardiff (or as is written everywhere there: Caerdydd). It is a bit strange that think that in the capital of Wales, the only Welsh you hear is in the train stations, but hardly on the streets. I felt a bit disappointed. But then again, for ‘the real Wales’ you should probably go more to the Northwest and go walking around (“Walking in Wales”, as Katrin and Joke were busy doing). After arriving in our air bnb, we took a trip to the National Museum of Cardiff (time constraints). We saw dinosaurs and Agatha Christies.\n Flying dinosaur\n “How’s your head?” - “Haven’t had any complaints”\n Hello dodo :D\n Turtle skeleton + shell!\n Portrait of Agatha Christie\n books by Agatha Christie\nThat the Welsh are proud of their differences as compared to the English is very obvious though. You can see it in funny takes on literary classics for instance:\n In this photo they ‘Welshized’ the titles of these famous works. My personal favourite is Catch me if you can, transformed in Cwtch me if you can. A cwtch is a ‘hug’ in Welsh.\nAnother instance where you can see their Welshness is in their ability to smack a dragon on anything. The rainbow flag for instance:\n\nIn Cardiff you can also visit the beautiful Cardiff Castle, aptly named because it is a castle in Cardiff. The oldest parts have been there since Roman times, which then were improved upon in Mediaeval times and supplied with an extra 18th century castle later on.\n The site of Cardiff Castle\nWhen we went there, the weather was not cooperating. This is mainly due to the bad weather Wales gets in general. However, there is enough inside and outside sights to see on the castle site. You can go all the way up the old castle [built on a mound!], and you can explore the aristocratic lifestyle of the Bute family, which held the site for many a year.\n Swag selfie\n The ‘new’ castle and a bit of Cardiff behind it\n The Arab room inside the Bute castle\n Library of the Bute family\n Ancient scripts!!!! From left to right, we see Ancient Greek, Cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Hebrew[?].\nAfter visiting the old castle and the new one, we did the last ‘attraction’: a walk through the tunnels that emulated what it was like during the WWII. We got all the way to the end of one tunnel and saw a poster talking about the benefits of handkerchiefs, so I of course tried to tell CJ about these benefits. I opened my mouth and all of a sudden a voice came from in around the corner: “Thomas???” (In perfect Flemish Dutch, even perfect recognisable sounds). We had run into Joke and Katrin. Their walking tour in Wales had taken them to Cardiff castle where they were walking through the dark tunnel. It was such a coincidence, but it’s always nice to meet your friends in this big world that at times seems very small.\n In the tunnel\n The girls were almost blown away\nWell, after a nice chit and a good chat we walked out of the castle and each group went its own ways. Joke and Katrin went on walking to the train station, where they would go to Bath (we recommended it), then to London. And in London they would see Aladdin the musical, do some day trips to Cambridge and Ipswich [they were very obsessed with the funny sounding name] and meet us again for Chinese hot pot when we got to London as well. Team Taiwan went on to the Dr. Who Experience, an experience that was very similar to the Harry Potter exhibition I visited last year in Brussels.\n The harbour\nIt was a nice and loooong walk to the harbour where the Experience was located in a hangar. But it was so worth it. Now, the Experience itself was this interactive play where we had to save the universe, following a guide in the ‘Gallifreyan museum’. He took us through some of the more famous monsters in the Dr. Who universe [called the ‘Whoniverse’ with a very forced blended word]. And some people there were really excited about it. One girl was dressed as the TARDIS, the blue police box the Doctor travels in. Below I’ll just show some pictures from the exhibition part, because it was awesome!\nTARDIS girl\n TARDIS on the inside\n Me and the Face of Boe\n CJ and an Ood\n Mummy on the Orient Express\n River Song’s outfits\n CJ meets the Daleks\n I turn into wood\n CJ being deleted by the Cybermen\n Crazy Cat Lady nurse [coincidentally the first episode I watched] and the robots from The Girls in the Fireplace\n Don’t Blink\n I bet you blinked.\n Davros.\n TARDIS for Clara\n Costumes of the all the Doctors, and random guy\n\n\nSaint Fagans\nWe also did a small day trip from Cardiff to Saint Fagans, which can only be described as ‘the Bokrijk of Wales’ and I urge them to start promoting themselves in this way. In this picturesque park you will see farms, barns and sheds, as well as some iron age reconstructions of huts.\n CJ and a hut-barn-shed-farm\nYou may (rightly?) think that you don’t feel like walking a whole day in this park, BUT apart from it being free, you also get to see a BEAUTIFUL castle. When I laid eyes upon it I knew the whole day trip had been worth my while. I mean, yes it’s nice to see sheds, farms, barns and huts, but we get them in Loenhout as well, you know. Castles (of this type) are a different thing.\n Wowzersss, Saint Fagans castle\n Garden next to the castle\n Secret Garden?\nSo yeah, with this our adventure in Wales came to an end. We said our goodbyes to the neighbourhood we were living at and to the beautiful Welsh language, never spoken in Cardiff, only seen, as on the Millennium Centre.\n Neighbourhood\n IN THESE STONES HORIZONS SING (by Karl Jenkins, check out the composition here) CREU GWIR FEL GWYDR O FFWRNAIS AWEN [Creating Truth Like Glass From Inspiration’s Furnace]\n\n\nLondon\nTaking the Great Western Railway (I just find the name so imposing that I already wrote it twice in this update) back Eastwards to London. We arrived in Greenwich, where we had our air bnb, and it was a very nice host in a nice place. He told us about how you can take the ferry as part of the public transport system (something you can actually also do in Prague!!), so that’s what we did to go from Greenwich all the way to Westminster, the next day that is. The first evening we were having hot pot with Joke and Katrin, remember?? (If not look up)\n Us on the catamaran\n The London Eye\n Westminster Abbey\n Trafalgar square\n Lion at Nelson’s column with Chinese boy\nAfter this water and road tour of touristy London, we went to National Portrait Gallery, where we were greeted by this era’s favourite redhead, Ed Sheeran.\n Ed Sheeran\nOf course he was not the only VIP present. Here are some more:\n Amy ‘BYOB’ Winehouse\n Queen Elizabeth ‘I’m still here’ II\n Tom ‘Loki in the Marvel universe’ Hiddleston\n Dame Maggie ’McGonnagall/Anderling/Downton Abbey is my b*tch’ Smith\n Dame Judi ‘M recently opened a Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India’ Dench\n Pocahontas Realness\n Oscar ‘Is this Stephen Fry’ Wilde\n Alexander ‘I make dresses’ McQueen and Isabella ‘I edit magazines’ Blow. This was also the Portrait of the Day, so we got the chance to listen to a detailed discussion of it. Well worth it.\nThen we went to that other museum in London — the British Museum. Tip from my anglophile friend Cedric: Take the back entrance. So we did that, wrenching our way into the museum between all the Korean tour groups. And lo and behold, we were greeted by a Moai (Easter Island statue), whose name apparently is Hoa Hakananai’a.\n Hoa Hakananai’a\nNext we had some Meso-American thingies: some Maya stelae and Aztec artifacts. I was also thrilled that the Museum shop had Michael D. Coe’s Breaking the Maya code, a book I had been wanting to read for some time now, and was even prepared to read a German version of it for, called Das Geheimnis der Maya-Schrift. Ein Code wird entschlüsselt. I wrote a review about the book:\n\n\nThis book fulfils what its title promises: it details how the maya glyphs were deciphered and the struggle it took the many Mayanists to get there. If you are looking for a detailed introduction to a Classical (or living) Maya language, this is not your book. Nor will you find all the glyphs that have been deciphered so far with all their variants. No, what you do get is more to the core and possibly more interesting: an introduction to how the system worked and how it was suited to its needs. We get a comparative chapter on other ancient writing systems, with special attention to Egyptian hieroglyphs and their decipherment in the 19th century, as well as an introduction to the Maya lifestyle. This is followed by the occasional good ideas and many more bad ideas that hindered decipherment. Many other reviewers seem to think that Coe is too severe on Thompson’s role in playing down inventive ideas in the 20th century, but it seems the reason why Coe is so negative towards him is well grounded. After all, it is not uncommon in different scholarly and scientific branches to have people who are so convinced of their own right that, even in the face of irrefutable proof, they will not give in but instead become more vehement in their self-righteousnesss. An excellent example of another field is for instance how Einstein was against the mere idea of the Big Bang, now well-accepted, because it did not fit in with his own theories. It took him many years to wrap his head around it (all the while discrediting the proponents of that theory) until he adapted his own brain stuff. So, to be short, this book that had been on my want-to-read list, was a really engaging semi-autobiographical book that was informative, fun, and often very sassy. Also makes me want to become a Mayanist, but I’m already a Sinologist :)\n\n\n Maya stela\n Maya stela\n Aztec Necklace\nWe passed the Sumerian and Akkadian section, all the way towards the Egyptian mummies. Passing by some pretty thingies, you really like the museum more with every room that is discovered. I wish more museums would be free to the public, because that is what they were meant for — inciting wonder and inspiring visitors.\n CJ and a Sumerian lion\n Akkadian stela. I think it reads “Never skip leg day”.\n Super old Sumerian game, owned by my friend Céline, who is a PhD student in Assyriology in Vienna. Read her blog here (but first finish mine).\n Pretty little thingie\n Aleph in a cage\n the Death scroll &lt;3\n Old chess set\n Horse next to the Parthenon\nThis crooked horse also reminds me of one of the most vivid memories in the British Museum. In secondary school we went on a trip to London and even though we had bought all-day passes for the underground we did everything on foot. We had a fast-footed Latin teacher, whom I shall refer to as Mrs. Store, who was in love with her field and managed to install some of her passion into most of her students. I still keep in touch with her. However, as we had walked all day, we just wanted to have a small sitting break. Not much, just a minute or two. But she would not give in. “Allez joeng, we are at the Parthenon, how is it possible that you want to sit???” It would and did not happen. Nobody was sitting. But then we got at the next section, a small corridor with a small bench. And it so happened to be free. She saw the desperate look in our eyes and finally gave in. We all (about 22 people) managed to sit down on a bench that was not meant for this many people. But we did it. This is that bench.\n THE BENCH\n THE BENCH\nSo I don’t know if the British Museum knows about it, but that bench has become a museum piece itself.\n THE BENCH is very close to this horse and reposing naked man\n I have an unhealthy interest in taking pictures with Sekhmet statues\n\n\nCambridge\nOn our penultimate day we went away for a day, to Cambridge, where CJ’s twin brother TJ is doing his PhD in glaciology, although he refers to it as geology to outsiders. Like Oxford, Cambridge (which was actually founded by people who left Oxford) is essentially a university town. And like Oxford, it was overrun with Chinese. And like Oxford, there are many colleges that can be visited. Especially if you have inside connections, which we just happened to have. We had lunch at Darwin’s, then visited King’s college (where there would be a ‘monumental stone written by the Great Xu Mozhi and visited by all Chinese speaking folk on this planet that found their way to Cambridge’ but the great Xu Mozhi’s poetry is very bad (not only in English but even more so in Chinese), and I can say so because I bought an anthology and want my pounds back), Trinity college, St. John’s, Jesus college and Pembroke college, where my anglophile friend Cedric was a visiting scholar. After a a nice 5-pound-pizza with CJ’s brother and his friends, we went to St. Edmund’s college for a really interesting evening making new friends. I don’t know if it was this personal touch, but if I have to choose sides, my money now is on Cambridge rather than Oxford.\n “It hurts my eyes to look in the camera but at least I’m trying”\n Punting is a thing here\n So are cool paintings in churches\n Shout out to my man Bacon\n Let’s not forget about my man Newton\n We’re smiling\n Inside one the churches\n Okay it may have been the beautiful King’s college church\n Nice sigils you got there\n The weather could have been better, it was, later on\n “Don’t walk on the grass” so I didn’t.\n\n\nLondon, Calais, Brussels\nSo that concluded the tour of the UK as we did it. I had a blast with CJ and Joke and Katrin, even when it was unplanned :). The last day in London we went to see a play, Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap, which was nice. And then it was time to go back home. So we went to Platform 9 3/4 in King’s Cross station and took the underground to the nearby St. Pancras station, to take the Eurostar express back home. One week was left in Belgium, during which we met up with some friends and family that I miss already. On the other hand, I had a great holiday and am ready for the new academic year.

    "text": "tl; dr\nThis double blog is first about the opening line of the Book of Odes, and later about how to deal with Chinese word segmentation, and my current implementation of it. So if you’re only interested in the computational part, look at the next one. If, on the other hand, you want to know more about my views on the translation of guān guān etc., look at the first part.\n\n\nIntro\nThe other day I was browsing through some academic journals, and I came across this article by Geoffrey Sampson, who I know mostly from (convincingly) attacking the Language Instinct hypothesis in linguistics. That led me to his website ( see here for the Language Instinct thing ), where I then found out has written a book that translates 58 poems from the Shījīng 詩經, the Book of Odes or Book of Songs as it’s most commonly known in English. Sampson uses Baxter’s (1992) reconstruction of Old Chinese on the left-hand side and translates poems on the right-hand side, see here. This book was also reviewed by the Edward Shaughnessy, an expert on very old Chinese (Shaughnessy, Edward. 2008. Modern Philology (106). 197-2000), where he argued that it’s a nice translation, but then critiques some of the choices made.\n\n\nThe issue\nAnd this is where I address the topic of this blog post. The criticism is about the very first stanza of the very first ode of the Shījīng, called Guān jū 關雎. I’ll first give this poem in full, with a translation by James Legge (dating from 1871), based on the ctext and the book (The She King) iself.\n\n關關雎鳩、在河之洲。\n窈窕淑女、君子好逑。\n\n\nKwan-kwan go the ospreys,\nOn the islet in the river.\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady: —\nFor our prince a good mate she.\n\n\n參差荇菜、左右流之。\n窈窕淑女、寤寐求之。\n求之不得、寤寐思服。\n悠哉悠哉、輾轉反側。\n\n\nHere long, there short, is the duckweed,\nTo the left, to the right, borne about by the current.\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady: —\nWaking and sleeping, he sought her.\nHe sought her and found her not,\nAnd waking and sleeping he thought about her.\nLong he thought; oh! long and anxiously;\nOn his side, on his back, he turned, and back again.\n\n\n參差荇菜、左右采之。\n窈窕淑女、琴瑟友之。\n參差荇菜、左右芼之。\n窈窕淑女、鍾鼓樂之。\n\n\nHere long, there short, is the duckweed;\nOn the left, on the right, we gather it.\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady: —\nWith lutes, small and large, let us give her friendly welcome.\nHere long, there short, is the duckweed;\nOn the left, on the right, we cook and present it.\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady: —\nWith bells and drums let us show our delight in her.\n\nSo as I said, Sampson’s (2006) version gives the first line as follows:\n\nKrón, krón, tsa-kou\nDzúh gáy tu tou\nÍwh-líwh diwk nrah\nKoun-tzuh hóuh grou.\n\n\nKrón, krón calls the fish-hawk on an islet in the river.\nA girl who is lovely and good\nIs the fit match for a princely man.\n\nLet’s first see how this compares to the other translations Shaughnessy discusses, for example Arthur Waley (1937 / 1987:81):\n\n‘Fair, fair,’ cry the ospreys\nOn the island in the river.\nLovely is this noble lady,\nFit bride for our lord.\n\nOr Bernhard Karlgren (1950:2):\n\nKwan-kwan (cries) the ts’ü-kiu bird, on the islet of the river;\nthe beautiful and good girl, she is a good mate for the lord.\n\nAs for the quality of translation, I agree with Shaughnessy that Sampson’s is not necessarily better than Legge, Waley or Karlgren. My personal preference in this case still goes to the one by Legge (1871!).\n\n\nThe first ideophone\nBut what is the most interesting, of course, is the SOUND ideophone (onomatopoeia) all the way in the beginning of the poem. There seem to be a few choices possible: 1. either you keep the sound of the current Mandarin reading, i.e. guānguān / kwan-kwan; 2. or you translate with a possible English equivalent, i.e. fair fair; 3. or you use the reconstructed pronunciation, to evoque what it might have sounded like (phonologically) in ancient times, i.e. kron kron.\nSo Shaughnessy at first seems to somewhat applaud the usage of kron kron:\n\nIn principle, I believe that being able to “hear” the original is important to an appreciation of poetry, and so I think that the addition of these phonetic reconstructions is to be welcomed (although I am not at all sure that for readers who do not know Chinese “Krón, krón, tsa-kou” Sampson’s reconstruction, is much to be preferred over “Guan guan ju jiu” the standard Romanization of the modern Chinese pronunciation).\n\nBut later on he critiques this first line as well:\n\n“Krón, krón” is supposed to be onomatopoeia for the sound that the fish-hawk makes as he calls to his mate. But here as elsewhere in the Shi jing, when animals, and especially birds, cry out, they do so in Chinese. In any event, their cries are necessarily rendered in Chinese characters, and the characters were obviously chosen not only for their sound but also for their meaning.\n\nThis is followed by Shaughnessy inspecting Sampson’s glossary, where a singular krón is glossed as a crossbeam in a gate, and then extended to include meanings as diverse as ‘pass (through mountains)’, ‘close’, ‘join, be related’. And onomasiologically its form is similar to another word guan, reconstructed as kons ‘to pass through’, but extended to ‘penetrate’ (yes in the sexual way). So Shaughnessy argues that there is some penetrating punning going on:\n\nIt seems to me that the fish-hawk is literally seeking “join” with his mate, and any translation that does not reflect that sense leaves the reader at an immediate loss.\n\nWhile the rest of the review makes some good comments about the themes of lust (no caution) in the Shījīng, this rubbed me a little in the wrong way. But let’s now turn to Sampson’s reply.\nThe biggest point Sampson makes is that Chinese studies should do more popularizing their findings, and that can be said of many disciplines. Books like his Love songs in Early China do contribute to that goal.\nThen, about the first stanza where Shaughnessy critized Sampson’s krón (krón) as involving a double entendre, Sampson dryly remarks: “Perhaps”. And this is an apt response.\nIt baffles me as well how you can relate onomatopoeia / SOUND ideophones, yes composed of characters, to just a reduplication of a homophone in this case. As if translating 關關 with ‘beam-beam’, or ‘join-join’ (Sampson), or ‘pass-pass’ makes sense. Shaughnessy’s point makes as much sense as in the hypothetical situation where we would have boe, daar is de koe “moo, there is the cow” in Dutch with an English translation. But boe not only is the sound of a cow in Dutch, it is also what you use to scare someone, cf. English boo. So should that extension into the semantic domain of FEAR be brought into the translation? Perhaps. Or, second similar example: tok tok tok — vier kippen op een rij “cluck cluck (cluck) — four chickens arranged in a row”. Should we be translating tok tok tok as ‘cluck’, or knowing full well that the sequence tok tok tok is also used for ‘knocking sound (on a door)’, as “knock-knock go the four chickens”? Perhaps not.\nThese silly examples are just thrown in here to show that, as Sampson argues, it is “irrelevant” to go looking up his krón when dealing with krón krón. The second retort is about the formally similar kons. Shaughnessy doesn’t give any characters (or tones) in his review, but this is what Sampson finds:\n\nHaving argued that 關, krón, should be read partly for its sense, Shaughnessy then claims to discern yet another layer of meaning: he says that this word is “similar in pronunciation” to 貫, whose primary meaning is “to pass through” but which has “the extended sense of sexual penetration”. So perhaps the translation should be not ” ‘Join, join’ …” but rather ” ‘Screw, screw’ calls the fish-hawk”.\n\n\nI find it surprising that the words 關 and 貫 were similar enough to be confusable in the Old Chinese period. (They are pronounced similarly in modern Mandarin – kuan1 [guān] versus kuan4 [guàn], a difference of tone only; but 貫 is normally taken to have ended in -s in Old Chinese: Shaughnessy gives it the pronunciation kons, and I would write kóns.) However, in private correspondence Shaughnessy has shown me good evidence that the words were treated as to some extent interchangeable. Nevertheless, I remain sceptical about whether the meaning, rather than the pronunciation, of either word was relevant to hearers’ appreciation of the poem. Rendering a crowing sound into human speech by using a word pronounced krón seems very natural. Translating the first word of the Book of Odes into English with a term referring to sexual penetration would not only read bizarrely but be philologically gratuitous. (It might have helped with sales, perhaps.)\n\nThis also piqued my interest. While it may be true that these words were somewhat interchangeable, in single syllables, it is still a bit harder to argue that the same goes for the reduplicated form, especially if we’re dealing with SOUND ideophones, who usually display IMAGIC ICONICITY (cf. all the literature on ideophones ever in the last ten years or so, but also e.g. Dingemanse 2012; Thompson 2019).\nBut let’s follow the argument okay, and compare with some advances in the reconstruction of Old Chinese phonology. The table below shows the Mandarin, Middle Chinese (Baxter 1992) and Old Chinese (Baxter & Sagart 2014; B&S) as it is found on their website, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncharacter\nMandarin\nMiddle Chinese\nOld Chinese\nsource\n\n\n\n\n關(关)\nguān\nkwaen\n[k]ˤro[n]\nB&S (2014)\n\n\n關\nkwan1\n\nkrón\nSampson (2006; 2009)\n\n\nguan\n\nkron\nShaughnessy (2008)\n\n\n\nguan\n\nkons\nShaughnessy (2008)\n\n\n\n貫\nkwan4\n\nkóns\nSampson (2009)\n\n\n貫\nguàn\nkwan\n[k]ˤo[n]-s\nB&S (2014)\n\n\n管\nguǎn\nkwanX\n[k]ˤo[n]ʔ\nB&S (2014)\n\n\n口管\nguān (?)\nkwan (?)\n[k]ˤo[n] (?)\n?\n\n\n\nI tried ordering them according to the train of thought in this debate: so first you have the current B&S transcription, basically kˤron, then Sampson’s krón, followed by Shaughnessy’s krón and possible formal variant kons, followed by Sampson’s answer that that would be kóns in his system. Next I give the B&S version of that kons/kóns, and the last two are suggestions I found in Legge (1871): that 關 is sometimes read as 管 or MOUTH(口)-管, ‘flute’. Personally, those last ones seem the most convincing for alternative characters of 關關: 管管 or (口管口管) ‘flute flute’, as in a sharp sound or so.\nNow what does the biggest dictionary of Chinese I have access to say about 關關? The Hànyǔ dà cídiǎn 漢語大詞典 says:\n\n1.鳥類雌雄相和的鳴聲。 後亦泛指鳥鳴聲。\nMating call of male and female birds.\n《詩‧周南‧關雎》： “關關雎鳩， 在河之洲。”\n毛 傳： “關關， 和聲也。”\n南朝 宋 鮑照 《代悲哉行》： “翩翩翔禽羅， 關關鳴鳥列。”\n清 陸以湉 《冷廬雜識‧道情》： “只聽得流水潺潺， 鳥語關關。”\n2.和諧安適貌。\nHarmonious.\n唐 錢起 《暇日覽舊詩因以題詠》： “逍遙心地得關關， 偶被功名涴我閒。”\n3.車行聲。\nSound of carts passing.\n明 何景明 《憶昔行》： “明星迢迢車關關， 遙向 楚 水辭 燕 山。”\n\nSo, no ‘beams’ in sight – maybe with some stretching you could argue for ‘passing through (of carts)’ and then that sound, but still mostly just the call of these mysterious birds. Yes, you read that correctly, we don’t actually really know what the bird is (or maybe now we do?, baidu and wikipedia do lead me to pictures), but the most common translation of jūjiū &lt; tshjo kjuw &lt; [tsʱ]a [k](r)u 雎鳩 is ‘osprey’ or ‘fish-hawk’. Perhaps they are indeed a symbol of sex, because they eat fish, and fish are sexual symbols (Shaughnessy 2008). Sampson (2009) notes that he just chose ‘fish-hawk’ because the osprey (apparently Pandion haliaetus) makes a very shrill sound, not very love-inspiring. Perhaps this was also a case of the literature critic – Shaugnessy – reading too much into a pragmatic translation choice.\nSo for me in general, it seems Sampson is the winner in this debate, it’s better to use krón krón (or maybe now kˤron kˤron if you want to be a Peter precise) than Mandarin guānguān or whatever translationese.\nBut he’s not entirely without faults either. A grave example is when Shaughnessy discusses the merits of using the reconstructed Old Chinese (cf. above):\n\n[…] (although I am not at all sure that for readers who do not know Chinese “Krón, krón, tsa-kou” Sampson’s reconstruction, is much to be preferred over “Guan guan ju jiu” the standard Romanization of the modern Chinese pronunciation).\n\nTo which Sampson responds:\n\nIf the line were considered in isolation like that, there would be little or no reason to prefer one pronunciation over the other; it takes two to tango, and it certainly takes two lines of poetry to rhyme. But the fact that the Book of Odes represents the first known use of rhyme anywhere in world literature is one of the fascinating things about it. So it would not be much use to an English-speaking reader to spell out the poems in a modern version of Chinese, in which the rhymes have been destroyed by three millennia of sound-change. (In Old Chinese, tsa-kou, fish-hawk, in the first line rhymed with tou, islet, in the second line, but in modern Mandarin chü-chiu scarcely rhymes with chou. In other cases the original rhymes, assonances, and so forth have been even more thoroughly wrecked in the modern language.)\n\nI’ve highlighted two parts: Sampson is right of course, the Shījīng is one of the prime examples of rhyme and has actually been super useful in reconstruction Old Chinese, see for instance this exciting research by List (2017; 2019). On the other hand, he remarks that “chü-chiu scarcely rhymes with chou”, which is a very strange remark to make, as jūjiū [tɕy˥ tɕjoʊ˥] of course rhymes with zhōu [ʈʂoʊ˥], there is not a hint of scarcely in sight.\n\n\nThe other ideophone\nYou thought this was soro soro (Jap. ソロソロ ‘any time now’) winding down, but no, not yet.\nI want to draw attention to the second line of the first stanza as well, and compare again the different translations.\n\n\n\nLine\nTranslator\n\n\n\n\n窈窕淑女\n\n\n\nyáotiáo shūnǚ\n\n\n\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady: —\nLegge (1871)\n\n\nLovely is this noble lady,\nWaley (1937)\n\n\nthe beautiful and good girl,\nKarlgren (1950)\n\n\nA girl who is lovely and good\nSampson (2006)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n君子好逑\n\n\n\njūnzi hǎo qiú\n\n\n\nFor our prince a good mate she.\nLegge (1871)\n\n\nFit bride for our lord.\nWaley (1937)\n\n\nshe is a good mate for the lord.\nKarlgren (1950)\n\n\nIs the fit match for a princely man.\nSampson (2006)\n\n\n\nOf course, I argue that this yáotiáo 窈窕 is also an ideophone, more precisely one that expresses EVALUATION based on VISION: the lady (shūnǚ 淑女) is evaluated as lovely, beautiful, good, befitting the lord or gentlemen (jūnzi 君子). Or, as it’s found in the Chinese Ideophone Database CHIDEOD:\n\nof women, coy and comely, reticent and withdrawn, winsome but withdrawn, delicate and demure; but some indication that the term can instead imply seductive sensuality; covert depths, hidden recesses; quiet(ly) and private(ly) (Kroll 2015)\n\nYáotiáo thus conforms to the crosslinguistic concept of an ideophone: it is marked (partial reduplication), a word (“listable in a lexicon”), that depicts (“not just describes”) a sensory image (“beautiful, lovely woman”) and belongs to an open lexical class, cf. Dingemanse (2012; 2019).\nBut do the translations above also conform what this ideophone depicts? Without taking into account factors like adhering to a metrical scheme (eight syllables or something similar), my preference without doubt goes to Legge’s translation, because he captures the antithetical forces of “wanting to depict but being only able to describe” the best: English doesn’t have any ideophones (as far as I’m aware) to depict the kind of women that befits this lord.\nBut perhaps you won’t agree. Let me know.\n\n\nThe end?\nAnyway, let me just end with the best mix-and-match of this stanza, or how I would do it, given a somewhat academic audience and enough space, i.e. here on my blog.\nFirst I would give Baxter & Sagart’s reconstruction:\n\n[k]ˤro[n] [k]ˤro[n] [tsʱ]a [k](r)u\n[dz]ˤəʕ [C.g]ˤaj tə tu\nʔˤ[e]wʔ lˤ[e]wʔ s-tiwk nraʔ\nC.qur tsəʔ qʱˤuʔ g(r)u\n\nThen I would give the Middle Chinese reconstruction, instead of Baxter (1992), I would opt for the IPA version (I converted with Sinopy):\n\nkwæn kwæn ʦʰjo kjuw¹\nʣoj² ɣa ʨi ʨuw¹\nʔew² dew² ɕuwk ɳjo³\nkjun ʦi² xaw³ gjuw¹\n\nLast I would provide the Mandarin pronunciation:\n\nguānguān jūjiū\nzài hé zhī zhōu\nyǎotiǎo shūnǚ\njūnzi hǎo qiú\n\nThis way you can kind of see how sounds change, as well as the way people perceive the “sounds of the Shījīng. Of course, we would need characters as well:\n\n關關雎鳩，\n在河之洲。\n窈窕淑女，\n君子好逑。\n\nAnd I would end with a translation:\n\nKrōn, krōn the físh-hawks cáll,\nón the íslet ín the ríver.\ndélicáte, demúre, young lády,\nfór the lórd a góód mate shé.\n\nOf course I borrowed from previous translations, but I also tried to mark the prosody so there’s four stressed syllables in the metre of each line. This, I think, is a more effective way of trying to marry the original four beat Chinese to English (where pentameter is the most frequent verse form).\nDidn’t like the translation? Make me a better one!\nI hope to see you back for the next update where we attack the problem of this verse and Chinese word segmentation.\nP.s. I have been quite lazy with my references, but if you want a specific reference, feel free to ask."

    "text": "The monosyllabic approach\nWhat I’m looking for is actually not just a segmentation tool for Modern Chinese (which is difficult enough), but I want one that also works for Classical Chinese / Old Chinese. The easiest option is to go with the idea that Classical Chinese is mostly monosyllabic (one syllable = one character = one word). If that is true, you can just go with the Julia Silge’s brilliant tidytext package (see free e-book here), and set your token = \"characters\". That this is a possible venue is shown here by a certain jjon987, who does an exploratory analysis of some classics in Chinese.\nI would give that an A for exploratory analysis, but a B for segmentation. That is because what I’m looking for, is something that is able to also deal with polysyllabic words like ideophones, e.g. guānguān 關關 and yáotiáo 窈窕, or polysyllabic monomorphemes like jūnzi 君子, all present in this first stanza of the Shījīng. So we need something a bit more sophisiticated."

I’m curious if they can live up to the promises they make."

It’s a bit of a hassle to set up at first, but if you manage to do it, the rewars are pretty sweet.\nAs for packages libraries (python lingo), the jieba library works pretty well. But last week the CKIP team at Academia Sinica came out with this new tagging system, creatively called ckiptagger. At first sight, this one does seem to be able to enforce a dictionary, so maybe this is the one I want to be using. Let’s take these for a spin."

(Well, I guess I would want 好逑 to be split in 好 and 逑 as well, but for now it’s okay.)\nThe steps in this section thus consist of: 1. Providing target text (character vectors in R) 2. Making the dictionary (list in R) 3. Transforming the R dictionary to python dictionary (dictionary in python) 4. Running python script (import ckiptagger, load the ws data, run ws function with dictionary coerced) 5. Transform python object to nice dataframe in R (dataframe in R)\nI can readily see applications with a dictionary list taken from the Chinese Ideophone Database CHIDEOD, and maybe with other databases connected to it as well.\nBut I’m always open to hearing more ways of dealing with this preprocessing problem."

    "text": "In a time where most institutions of most countries (yay Taiwan!) have closed during the Spring semester, the Brazilian Association of Linguistics, a.k.a. ABRALIN (Associação Brasileira de Linguística), have invited lots of linguists across the world for online lectures that are freely available. I thought it would be a good idea to document here the ones I have seen, and liked enough to share. I will categorize them by linguistic subfield and shortly elaborate. The full programme is accessible here.\nAS A DISCLAIMER, I do want to point out that this blog reflects a number of observations and in general recommend everybody to watch all of the lectures. You can agree or disagree but I am mostly positive about the talks, because this is a great initiative. Also, the categorization in domains is just a tendency, often the talks fall in more specific categories.\n\n\n\n\nI was so happy to see Ameka included in the list of speakers as I know him from my literature review on ideophones. Interestingly, Ameka starts his presentation by referring to Joseph’s (1997) paper on linguistic marginalia. And then, unsurprisingly, the talk slowly shifts to ideophones and of course his old student Mark Dingemanse. While Ameka unfortunately misquotes Dingemanse’s (2011; 2012; 2019) cross-linguistic definition, what follows is a detailed case study of ideophones in the African Kwa languages he is most familiar with, Igbo and Ewe, and what we can learn from them. Ameka rightly argues for the obliteration between core vs. periphery. For the most part I agree with his approach, although I do hold some reservations about resorting to Natural Semantic Metalanguage to describe meanings. The last part of the talk is devoted to interjections, very interesting. This talk is highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll linguistic subfields are equal but some are more equal than others. Lexical semantics is the most equal.\n\n\n\n\nThis lecture is largely a copy of one of the basic texts that lexical semanticists should read: Geeraerts, Dirk. 2010. Theories of Lexical Semantics. One of Geeraerts’s greatest hits is the historical overview of different approaches to lexical semantics in the last 150 years or so. Highly recommended if you’re interested in this, especially because it becomes more interesting towards the end when he incorporates more recent trends that concern methodological choices that can be made when investigating words.\n\n\n\nThis presentation was relatively good. I browsed through Jackendoff’s books in the past and it is undeniable that he has had a lot of influence in the fields of morphology and lexical semantics. The main points of his talk are that 1) schemas are better than rules; and 2) (formal) syntax can learn a lot from looking at the special features of the lexicon, phrased in terms of schemas.\nThese insights are not that much of a bombshell to me, as the benefits of a schema-based approach rather than a rule-list fallacy are well-known within Cognitive Linguistics, cf. Bybee’s works since the 1980s. However, it is good that Jackendoff plays this intermediary role between formal and cognitive-functional approaches.\nOne point of concern is that Jackendoff keeps talking about how * louden and * safen do not occur in the English lexicon, but Ms Merriam Webster disagrees with that (louden and safen). Arguably, these are not super prototypical but even as a non-native speaker I had at least heard of loudening. This thus strongly suggests that maybe a usage-based approach is better than a purely intuition-based one.\nI do recommend the talk if you want to see Jackendoff and know more about his work.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhh, Formal Semantics, field that I do not understand. I liked Partee’s overview, not in the least because she is a big name in that field and has lived through most of its history. This talk succinctly summarizes a number of issues that have driven a plethora of inquiries into formal semantics, especially in the foundational stages. It was revealing, and I applaud her for stressing that formal semantics only does / can discuss a small section of natural languages (most of which are English).\nI deplore, however, that in America, this is largely seen as the only way of doing semantics (see also Geeraerts’s talk). Maybe it’s time for lexical semantics to spread further, but that may be my own bias.\nI loved her Q&A: she for instance stresses that the deep structure semantics differ across languages. She is acutely aware that formal semantics and lexical semantics are two different beasts.\nHighly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk starts out by trying to unify the worlds of formal semantics and lexical semantics, which made me feel excited. However, throughout the talk it becomes clear the paradigm she is working in is what Geeraerts refers to as Neo-Structuralist approaches to lexical semantics, which of course are somewhat relatable to the formal semantics enterprise. McNally spends a large amount of the talk on the comparison of figurative expressions of to sweep and barrar (Spanish), which I found very interesting, and I would recommend mostly this part of the talk, even though it is almost devoid of the huge – and I mean HUGE – amount of literature on metaphors as it is done in Cognitive Semantics, which I find a missed opportunity. On the other hand, during the Q&A McNally really shows a passion for semantics which is highly contagious. Good talk.\n\n\n\nThis is a pretty standard talk that gives the standard narrative of the different incarnations of generative grammar. Check it out here if that’s new for you and you feel compelled to know.\n\n\n\nThis is a talk that is focused on how indigenous peoples use language to talk about their environment. It features case studies on peoples from Vanuatu, Bolivia, Siberia, as well as other hot spots of dying languages [sad reacts only]. Interesting for me is that it starts with this discussion on botanical terms and folk terminology. Of course, such case studies played important roles in the proposal of basic level taxonomies. Linguistic knowledge is largely cultural knowledge. And that is the reason why I think that this talk belongs in the category of semantics.\nAfter this Harrison does a tour of typical topics of phrases and vocabulary that give some insight in the worldview of these peoples: flora, fauna, time (months etc.), counting systems, way-finding and orientation. It seems that Environmental Linguistics is highly compatible with Cognitive Linguistics.\nInteresting given current events in the US with waves across the globe is his discussion on strategies to decolonize linguistics:\n\nTake encyclopedic knowledge of indigenous peoples seriously.\nRespect indigenous ways of pedagogy.\nTreat consultants as co-authors, respect their intellectual property.\n\nAs a bonus, Harrison mentions the Talking Dictionaries App. Go check it out y’all.\nHighly recommended:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this talk, which is very fundamental in nature and based on Standard Average European languages, I will remember that piano trio ‘piano accompanying violin and cello (not pianos)’ is a form of onomasiological coercion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was looking forward to this talk by Hilpert, having seen him present last year at ICLC 15 in Japan on Causation, Culture, and Constructional Change, click here for the handout. However, it turns out that his Abralin talk is the same talk! Now I’m happy to see it again, and also for a broader audience and his three linguistics problems, or rather, things to watch out for, are definitely something that all linguistics should take into account:\n\nFillmore’s screwdriver: our linguistic corpora do not really reflect language usage proportionately, e.g., screwdrivers (or as I had heard it before, toothbrushes) are things we use ‘daily’, yet you don’t find them that much in corpora. Or as Hilpert summarized it: Cultural features cannot be indexed by word-use frequencies.\nFlach’s grammar lesson: Word-use frequencies have to be controlled for grammatical contexts.\nthe rising sea levels of Koplenig and Müller-Spitzer: Correlations in time-series data can be spurious if they are not controlled by correlating changes, rather than absolute values.\n\nHilpert then shows a number of interesting observations and studies about the English Causative.\nProblematic in his talk are his definitions of semasiological frequency (“How often do speakers verbalize a given concept?”) and onomasiological frequency (“How often do speakers experience a given concept?”). I’m sorry but that is just wrong. Semasiology deals with the mapping from label to meaning, so its frequency asks questions about how often does a particular meaning occur with a label. For example, a word like paint, how often does the meaning PAINT A PORTRAIT occur vs. the meaning PAINT A WALL, arguably two different kinds of painting. Onomasiology, on the other hand, takes the mapping from meaning to label into account and consequently its frequency asks about how often do labels co-occur with a given meaning. For example, the meaning of FATHER that can be expressed by dad, father, papa, pops, daddy etc. It is actually quite baffling that almost a year after his talk in Japan, where this issue was also raised, his presentation still contains these issues. I hope he can improve it the next time he gives this presentation.\nI highly recommend this talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was an amazing talk. Gildea, who I was only indirectly familiar with, really knows his stuff and takes us through the well-known cases of (split) ergativity etc. to then show how diachronic comparative syntax can (and maybe should) look like. Amazing talk and highly recommended!\nDuring the Q&A he discusses Joseph’s talk (below) who stated that grammaticalization is not a process. For Gildea is absolutely is a process, driven by the mechanisms of reanalysis and analogy. I tend to agree with that as well – it’s also in the term itself: -ization indicates processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph is a quite well-known grammaticalization guy who views it as “the embedding into grammar (the taking on of grammatical status) of once-non- (or less-) grammatical phenomena”. Rather than as a process, grammaticalization is a product (result, state) of regular sound change, borrowing, and analogy (metaphorical shift in meaning). He goes through many case studies, focusing on internal reconstruction, which is making the best of imperfect data and which offers a hypothesis, trying to deduce the historical events that led to a synchronic state. Interesting case studies include one on the adverbial marker -mente/mente in Spanish (or other Romance languages) or Greek meli ‘honey’ and onoma ‘name’. In the end he links grammaticalization back to what the Neogrammarians were doing in the 19th century, which is not really new for me (that is how we were taught Linguistics 101 in Leuven), but it may be new for American-oriented linguists who typically get a lot of generative linguistics as the supposed starting point of linguistics.\nI love his Q&A as well, very informative!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another life, where I would have studied Romance languages at KU Leuven, I probably would have taken Cornillie’s classes. I really enjoyed this talk about a case study, threaten to fall (and cognates in other Western-European languages) construction that previously was argued to arise from contact with French, but which Cornillie gracefully shows to have come from Latin. Which Latin? Exactly, that is what a large chunk of this talk is about. Don’t want to spoil it for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk is kind of weird for me, because I almost had Lahousse’s class back when I did my MA in Linguistics at KU Leuven in 2014. However, because she was pregnant at the time, we had a guest lecturer, who was in direct contact with her. So we still got her course, just not taught by her. I still recognize a number of topics that we had to read about, and I worked on topics of Chinese and Japaense for my term paper.\nThis talk is recommended if you are interested in the study of a number of Romance languages and how they form a continuum. I does bother me a bit that it’s only French, Spanish and Italian, when there are all of these other languages that are in between. Maybe that would really provide an even more fine-grained continuum in the typology of Romance languages. I enjoyed the talk though.\n\n\n\nMore Romance languages! This talk shows that discourse traditions are important when doing historical linguistics.\n\n\n\nThis talk is actually a long case study of Montréal French. Sankoff and colleagues find that the auxiliary être is being replaced by avoir (insert shock face); a change in the speed of the adoption /ʀ/, coming from /r/; the replacement of the periphrastic future (aller + infinitive) to the detriment of the inflected future. Cool talk!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfession: I have a huge respect for the work of Gries and have used a number of his studies in my dissertation. This presentation shows quite well what quantitative corpus linguistics can be used for, and does a good job in instilling with the listener a sense of wanting to know more about this approach.\nThe part about using a firearm at the end of the talk (starting around minute 52) was highly relevant to current events and extremely interesting: what is the ordinary meaning of a word?\n\n\n\n\n\nDavies talks about the importance of corpora and the amount of data. He supports the idea that corpus linguistics is a methodology rather than a field, and I tend to agree with that. Corpora provide data, the theoretical conclusions that are drawn based on it depends on frameworks, fields and persuasions.\nMost of the talk is a basic overview of what phenomena you can study with corpus data (mostly COCA), how to do it. Interesting is the typical case study of the semantic change of gay. In terms of statistics, it is mostly phrased in terms of simple absolute frequencies rather than association measures. A good first step, but maybe not enough.\nGood talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk features Marianne Mithun talking about intonation units from the interaction between theory and case study. Amina Mettouchi presents a corpus that can help study prosody, with special focus on Afro Asiatic languages. Alessandro Panunzi presents yet another corpus for studying prosody. The talks are recommended and can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurner turns out his greatest hit of conceptual blending theory and does so well. Note that he’s about 60 slides in before the moderator interrupts the talk to have him put on the slides as well. Recommended talk.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your Portuguese is up to standard and you’re interested in what Cognitive Linguistics is / does, this can be the talk for you. Check it out here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Minimalist Program is not a theory” is a mantra that is well-known within linguistics. But then, what is it?\nIn this talk Marcel den Dikken (literally: Marcel the fat one – he is not). For him, the quintessence of the Minimalist Program, after unmerging all of the principles from the Principles and Parameter program, contains five notions: Features, which need to be checked; Merge, to add stuff to the trees; Agree for feature evaluation; a notion of Locality (‘phase’); and a notion of Economy. But all of these are argued to be somewhat problematic. Note that if you aren’t used to the abbreviations of generative approaches (“GenSpeak” / “FormSpeak”?), you will find this talk to be moving too fast, as the comments also suggest.\nThe next speaker is Norbert Hornstein, who is clearly a major proponent of the Minimalist Program. He also highlights that this theoretical framework program is not a competitor to Government and Binding, but rather assumes that it is theoretically correct, only to move away from it. This was a point I didn’t really know, so it is good that this was emphasized. But what then remains is the question if Government and Biding indeed is correct. Further in the talk, there is a very long bit on some technicalities of the Merge operation. It strikes me that there is almost no language material in these talks. Almost as if the explanandum is not the data but the theory…\nThe last speaker is David Pesetsky, who shares “some impressions and anecdotes”. The Minimalist theory Program is described as exhortative speculative fiction: we are called to build this futuristic linguistic descriptive world. There are some anecdotes of the well-known core phenomena, leading Pesetsky to argue that the grammars in our heads are not constructions grammars, but follow principles and parameters. I guess it’s agree to disagree on this one then. Then there is of course the familiar “we found this in language after language, thus it must be correct”, which I have always found problematic: normally you want your scientific paradigm to be based on falsification, especially if you’re working with a minimal (pun intended) amount of data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a presentation but an interview with Pinker, famous for his The Language Instinct, a popsci book that was extremely influential in the last 20 years or so, and now infamous for the letter asking for his removal of the media expert panel of the LSA and the subsequent twitter storm (I don’t even know where to link because there is just so much). While I admire the acumen of Pinker and agree with a lot of things he found out – for instance, I love his style book (The Sense of Style) – I still disagree with many of views on language with parameters, and completely innate. A glimmer of hope shines through this talk near the end, where he advises us to become eclectic, as opposed to adhere to 1 school of thought, “because assumptions get in the way”. But of course, every theory or framework makes use of a number of assumptions; you just need to become or stay aware about them. However, this awareness is not equally present across frameworks. Recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a talk that unexpectedly liked a lot and highly recommend. Aboh’s main point is that most people are multilingual, and that our models of studying should reflect this, not just in terms of code-switching (although he devotes most of his efforts to this situation), but also in terms of familiarity with different genres etc. Also unexpected then, is that this is definitely wrapped within generative / formal linguistics, a group of frameworks I thought focuses mostly on monolingual situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nI mistakenly first categorized this as a form of Cognitive Linguistics (see Soares da Silva below), but make no mistake, Dynamic Linguistics is an offshoot of Generative Semantics. Rojas-Berscia takes us on a tour of what this framework entails. It’s interesting to see how a different approach to variation (with lects and all) than the one I’m used to plays out.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny alternative to traditional Chomskyan grammar deserves a closer look, and Seuren’s Semantic Syntax model is quite interesting, as it rejects the neo-positivist nature of the former, and does not treat syntax as a “random sentence generator”. I did not know about Semantic Syntax, but I like how it clearly includes speech acts, lexical choices etc. However, it does seem to fall into the rule-list fallacy? I need to follow up on this model. It is also quite interesting to see how Rojas-Berscia’s presentation follows this model, which makes sense in hindsight. Lastly, the Q&A is highly recommended as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, I did not know that Estonian was the only V2 language of the Uralic languages. Holmberg argues that this is because of language contact with Germans who migrated to Estonia and became dominant in the past. If you were ever curious of seeing trees made with Finnish and Estonian data, this is your chance.\n\n\n\nThis talk is what I thought Adger’s would be like. Demonte introduces the Minimalist Program, while focusing on variation and Spanish. Revealing for me, even though I think the notion of interface has it backwards: in language, it’s not a combination of different fields that has more real status; the fields are abstractions from something highly multimodal. I also think that it’s hard to study variation without quantification. In this paradigm things are phrased in terms of passing or failing a certain (syntactic) test…\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, this one is the first guest in this series of lectures on linguistics. Very surprisingly, however, this one is not about linguistics. Disappointing.\nYou can find it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI recently read McCulloch’s book Because Internet, because how could you not; it has been appearing on all the blogs I follow. Tbh, sometimes I think her style on her blog is a bit too unacademic, but I guess that’s the point: she wants to get people more interested in language in general, and does this through the topic of internet usage. This talk is actually wonderful and I really enjoy her passion of her research object and I wish we had more people who do the popularisation of linguistics well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a somewhat unexpected talk; I had expected Adger to go full on minimalist program on us (which I actually would have liked – I think the people that watch these Abralin lectures are presumably quite well-versed in linguistic theories), but I will never say no to conlangs. Cool talk.\n\n\n\nCrystal is a household name in the popularization of linguistics and I have enjoyed a good number of his books. This talk is a bit different than the other ones, however, in the sense that this is an interview and it is kind of linguistics-light. I do not really recommend it (read: I took one for the team), as they are somewhat prescriptivist in their positions. For example, both parties agree that social distancing is a bad term “because it’s physical distancing”. You can’t go to war with those kinds of observations.\nYou can find it here, should you be interested.\n\n\n\n\nOkay maybe the category of Anthroplogical linguistics isn’t the best term but it is a bucket category of important aspects of language and linguistics that do not readily fit with the other ones.\n\n\nThis is an interesting talk by Pirahã-famous Dan Everett. If you are into the archeology of homonids and the phenomenon of languages, this is highly recommended. There are lots of Peircean semiotics in this talk. You can find it here.\n\n\n\nNgue Um starts his presentation with the well-known trope that “you linguistics is not about speaking many languages”, by asking: Why not? Why can’t linguists be assumed to speak multiple languages? Is it “pure science” advocacy? Is it a disregard to social engagement? Is it a historical bias? Is it neoliberalism? The talk is largely focused on arguing for more sociolinguistic approaches to the ‘languaging’ in Africa, rather than purely theoretical analyses. And it is quite convincing.On the other hand, some abstraction when sciencing does remain necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk mentions languaging (see Ngue Em) and multimodality as two keyterms for a better understanding of the sociolinguistics of Africa, but Makoni then goes beyond that by identifying underlying metaphors to uncover the epistemology and ontology of such approaches, e.g., “the lay-person”. The presentation is quite hard to follow because the slides aren’t shared.\n\n\n\nI thought this talk would be on a very similar vein as the ones by Ngue Um and Makoni, but actually Lüpke treats a whole range of issues that were not touched upon before. For instance, the issue of naming a language, the cultural value of speaking many languages (more is better, except in certain cases). I would recommend this talk after the previous two to form some kind of trilogy of African multilingualism and the lessons we can learn from it.\n\n\n\nI was looking forward to seeing and hearing Aikhenvald, a well-known typologist (#evidentiality) but this talk is unfortunately delivered in Portuguese (with English powerpoints), so not really accessible to me. Talk available here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty good introduction to the multimodality of the acquisition of language, how children go about languaging Gestures, pointing, gaze. I must confess that despite its importance in studies on ideophones, I never really got into it and thus just follow key findings. But I think this video showcases the importance of the multimodality in acquisition. Go see it here.\n\n\n\nThis talk was interesting for me because I finally got into what repair actually is. Basically it’s asking for clarification, with a huh?, a what?, a who? etc. These are very frequent in adult conversation. Not surprisingly, learning how to do this is an important part of acquisition, but also the adult checking up on the acquiring child is important. Clark goes into great detail on both sides of this coin. Great talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin Cognitive Linguistics, Tomasello has this status of being the acquisition guy, since he started working with usage-based data and proposed theories that make uses of schematization quite early on. I once saw a talk by him back in Leuven, which was very interesting, and have read a number of his books on acquisition, which were very insightful.\nThis talk goes further along his research axis in talking about the multimodality of acquisition, by focusing on gestures (pointing but also gaze), and comparing humans with primates. Recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk is the opposite of the body of work that Tomasello represents and I would have expected a serious alternative to Tomasello, couched in UG and Generative Grammar, to address issues that were maybe lacking in Tomasello’s work. But it’s just not there. This was not my cup of tea.\n\n\n\nThis talk looks at the acquisition from a mostly phonological point-of-view. There is some attention for Mandarin, which was particularly interesting for me, although I don’t know if I’m convinced by the idea that Mandarin infants mostly hear syllables rather than words… Check it out here.\n\n\n\nThis group talk looks at how children acquire reading skills. Important, because reading is fundamental.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagliamonte is a well-known sociolinguist, so I was looking forward to hearing this talk. She did deliver a large number of case studies performed in her career, with a big focus on Ontario dialects, which was quite interesting. She takes word frequencies as clues for further investigation and I guess that’s how it often goes: you learn a bit about something which prompts you to dig deeper. Good talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of the most important talks in this series, or at least one of the most relevant ones. DeGraff relates his talk also to the situation of Haiti.\nIn the beginning of the talk there is a screenshot with Black lives matter translated into different languages, including Chinese, where it says 「黑命无价」 hēi mìng wú jià ‘black life have.not price’, “black lives are priceless”. However, to me the negation in wú jià seems kind of negative. I would not translate it that way, even though the composite expression means ‘priceless’. Maybe a yě suàn 也算 ‘also count’ is a better way of translating? I’m curious to see other opinions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet another great talk on the social issue that grips the world right now. It forces us to think about the white gaze (also in academia). Highly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional view is that deliberate linguistic change is not something that is at all likely to have more than minor influence on a system. Thomason’s view, however, is that speakers can change anything in their language they can become aware of. What follows is a colorful display of (mostly phonological) examples of different factors that can induce deliberate change, such as: accommodation, distancing, secrecy, standardization, censure or ridicule avoidance, and identity construction.\nI particularly enjoyed her demonstrations of Salish demonstrations. Also interesting is the story behind the debate of possible pulmonic ingressives in Tsou. Thomason’s student Michael Fuller argued he found them (1990), but when Ladefoged & Zeitoun went to investigate (1993) they couldn’t find them. Thomason gives a plausible reason why the latter could not find them…\nA recommended talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk takes a while to get going, but it shows Labov’s eminence and longstanding status within the field of sociolinguistics. Especially in times of #BlackLivesMatter this is an important talk, because it goes in depth into AAVE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the title of this talk I thought it would be “just another talk on the weirdness of monolingual standards”, and it is that for sure, but it’s also so much more. I think especially near the end of the talk, when Sorace starts talking about economy and efficiency I was really hooked. Note, this presentation has some technical problems of some duration, so don’t be put off by the long initial lecture time. Very good!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk, which is in Portuguese, represents the sociolinguistic approach that I’m mostly familiar with, i.e., well-grounded in Cognitive Linguistic tenets. I have been following Soares da Silva’s work in the CLR series during my PhD, and have liked many of his papers. Unfortunately this talk is in Portuguese, so I couldn’t fully enjoy it. But I hope it inspired more members of the Brazilian target audience to follow in his footsteps.\n\n\n\nI like the way Poplack has outlined ‘code-switching’, a phenomenon that is well-studied yet defined or approached in wildly different ways, in this talk. She shows that most code-switching is not composed of multiword phrases, but rather single words, and the bulk of these are established loanwords. Most of these words are content words, mostly nouns.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent talk on a number of sociolinguistic issues, mostly America-focused. Watch it here.\n\n\n\nI wanted to like this talk but it just didn’t speak to me. Check it out here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one mentions Comrie you might think of aspect or tense, among many other works. In his talk he introduces the grammar of Akabea (Andaman). Recommended if you want to learn more about circumstantial fieldwork that resulted in a grammatical understanding. There is a large case study of the semantic extensions of aka ‘mouth’. Check it out here.\n\n\n\nThis talk goes through some case studies of what has worked in terms of strategies to make endangered languages less endangered. You can find it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrammaticalization expert Traugott discusses a number of discourse markers from a construction grammar perspective, e.g., by the way, which she analyzes brilliantly in the way that she is known for throughout her career. Curiously, she frames her study somewhat by stating that early Cognitive Linguists did not pay much attention to discourse (markers), referring to Fillmore (1988), Langacker (1987) or Goldberg (1995, 2006, 2019), and that it is odd because Sweetser (1990) talked about discourse markers. I find this a weird starting point, because it certainly is not the goal of Fillmore’s Frame semantics to talk about this phenomenon, so I don’t know why she would expect to find it there. Langacker’s Cognitive Grammar (1987) outlines the basic foundations of his theoretical apparatus, but in (2008) we find a whole section on discourse, which also has played an important part in Cognitive Grammar over the years, albeit from a introspective data approach. Goldberg’s work is also mostly focused on constructions that usually feature a verb; it seems that the discourse markers Traugott is interested in are not really of that nature. So it is strange that this is the point against which she frames her talk. BUT, a good talk nonetheless. Highly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lecture provides a decent overview of issues related to studying discourse from a Cognitive Linguistics perspective. I disagree with the starting point (also in the abstract) that states that “On-line phenomena, such as discourse processes unfolding in real time, can and should be explored from a cognitive perspective as well” (emphasis mine). Already in the second book in the CLR series, scholars have been dealing with issues like activation, reference etc. That is not to say that that treatment was sufficient – it was not – but we should also not pretend that CL has never looked at discourse. Recommended talk.\n\n\n\nThis talk focuses mostly on the utterances and information units. It features examples with special prosody that are very reminiscent of a certain fellow student of mine… Find the talk here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is more of a comprehensive talk about a relatively well-understood topic: dialects and accents in the UK. Later on Setter also talks about forensic linguistics, which was quite interesting. So it’s a recommended talk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk show how different approaches to sounds and sound change can work together to get a more comprehensive picture of what’s going on. Not my field, but very interesting!\n\n\n\nWell-known Dutch linguistic van Oostendorp (who is very active online) talks about his admiration for Roman Jakobson. He conveys his passion about one of Jakobson’s works that focuses on featural analysis of phonemes. However, I found the presentation format extremely unclear. Check it out if you’re interested.\n\n\n\nThis is a cool talk and one of the clearest phonetics presentations I’ve ever seen. This talk seems to be on the cusp of linguistics (more so than many other talks that take a more historical overview of a field as their topic).\n\n\n\nThis multiple people presentation is a bit more traditional in terms of phonetics presentations. It was interesting.\n\n\n\nThis talk, grounded in Natural phonology principles, talks about clusters.\n\n\n\nThis talk talks about the larynx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaspelmath is a well-known linguistic typologist. I have made use of his research in my research, especially when making the important distinction between cross-linguistics comparative concepts and language-particular categories. In this talk this is called the difference between g-linguistics and p-linguistics. This talk is about parallels between biology and linguistics, focusing on how evolutionary adaptation as an important factor for explaining phenomena. In biology such explanations are quite common, but in linguistics they are not. It is a good talk and recommended, although I remain skeptical about many of the issues raised during the Q&A and Haspelmath’s adaptability in terms of explanations.\nKind of weird is that there are lots of references to Haspelmath (2021) and Haspelmath (2021a). Did he come back from the future? Also weird is Haspelmath’s lumping together of Chomsky (1965) and Jackendoff (2002) with Langacker (1987) under the heading of complete bio-cognitive explanations of so-called p-languages, as opposed to cultural explanations or comparison with other languages (g-language). I think Cognitive Grammar, while focusing on cognition, is very much compatible with cultural types of explanation and tries to uncover a number of important features of language usage in general. This lumping together seems unwarranted.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this kind of thinking, where efficiency factors are studied in the production and reception of language usage; it’s very attractive, and I think it needs to become more widespread. This talk fits in well with a Cognitive Linguistics approach to sounds, although I’m not sure Wedel would see it like that as well. One interesting finding mentioned in this talk is that earlier segments have a higher cue validity than later segments, which we also know from other studies, but which can also be demonstrated with predictive text when texting. But of course, it also depends on how unique certain combinations are, I guess. And that is where the end of the talk goes towards: less probable words tend to have more segments (as in Zipf’s work), but less predictable words also have segments that more quickly distinguish them from competitors. I am quite curious if I can integrate some of the insights of this talk into my research on ideophones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk on pidgins shows the importance of historical context in the study of languages. I think the main point is that ‘pidgin’ is a very British colonization kind of term; while there was no Pidgin Portuguese, Pidgin French or Pidgin Dutch. The talk reminded me of Nicholas Ostler’s Empires of the Word: A language history of the world, which discusses the language policies of colonizers and colonized across time. Of course, Mufwene tells a story that ties in closer to current research into the emergence of the terms ‘pidgin’ and ‘creole’ and does so convincingly.\nI recommend this talk:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk presents a more traditional view of pidgins and creoles, compared to Mufwene’s talk, but does make the main basic (and correct) claim that creoles are real languages (not just mixed languages). Good!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I went into this talk with a negative view of McWhorther, stemming from my bad experiences with his The Language Hoax (see academic review here) and hearing him on other platforms where I often find myself disagreeing with many of his opinions because the logic often seems flawed (at least in the moment). However, I did like this talk. McWhorter mainly advocates against the idea that creoles are just mixtures of languages (‘uniformitarianism’), positions advanced by Mufwene and DeGraff. Instead, they come into being by converging some features of the donor languages, mediated by the effects of adult acquisition and the creation of non-native pidgins. Later in the talk he argues both that the genesis process of two languages (Tok Pisin and Sranan) is the same, even though we don’t have any historical traces of the pidgin stage of Sranan. The way he presents it is at most a conjecture, not a full deduction, so this is a weak point in his talk for me. But then later he addresses the issue of representativeness: how representative is the well-known case of Haitian creole for different creole languages, and I think that amounts to asking a very important question to which I don’t have an answer, but one that apparently should be answered asap in that field. Unlikely recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like these “intro to neurolinguistics” talks. This one is very thorough and intuitively (I say intuitively because I am not familiar with all of the intricacies of this subfield) is taking the right approaches to brain and language, although I don’t know about the conclusions (such as in 1). The main contributions of this talk / her program are that 1. brain regions that support language processing are selective for language (as opposed to supporting other abilities, e.g., music, arithmetic); 2. brain regions that support word meanings vs. syntactic processing are the same; 3. the primary driver of the language regions’ responses is semantic composition (and not structure building).\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not well-versed in the world of neuro- /psycholinguistics but I do enjoy the presentations that have found their way to me in the past few years. This talk is very much in line of that. There are lots of specifics of this subfield that are touched upon in this talk, but I remain unconvinced of the usability of generative grammar within this field, and while that still seems to be dominant, the field seems to become more and more aware of culture as well. Check it out y’all.\n\n\n\nMark Liberman, well-known from Language Log introduced a number of clinical applications of linguistics. Interesting talk with good future avenues of extension. Check it out here.\n\n\n\nAnother talk on neurolinguistics with three main case studies. It can be found here.\n\n\n\nThis is the dialectology / dialectometry talk you didn’t know you needed, at least for the first 20 minutes. After that it turns, curiously, to the world of neurolinguistics. I thought this talk was very interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brain has rhythms - and so do music and speech. In his talk, Poeppel takes us through a number of experiments that show this.\n\n\n\nIn this talk we learn that bilingualism is indeed a source of neuroplasticity that increases the attention systems / span in brain and behaviour. As a side note, coming from Belgium, it is hard to imagine anybody being completely being monolingual, although I probably know a few people like that…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteurs, who I have had meetings with when I was the student representative of the Faculty of Arts at KU Leuven, gives a quite comprehensive history of the translation technology in the last 70 years or so. Then she discusses some recent issues and tools. Really good talk if you ever wanted to know about this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool talk, in sign language (don’t worry, there’s a vocalizer next to it) about how deaf people sign when coming into contact with other sign languages.\n\n\n\nThis panel also delves deeper into the role the study of sign language can play in our conception of language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk shows how big data studies can help us interpret linguisitc cues as markers of (deteriorating) health. Interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk shows that framing and reframing is important. Stibbe discusses newspaper narratives: how immigrants had been framed as invaders in The Sun, but now are portrayed as the heroes (doctors, nurses etc.) fighting against COVID. At about minute 38 he talks about haiku, which was quite interesting, although I dislike the kind of “Japanese is so mysterious, so exotic” attitude that is displayed in this lecture."

Interestingly, Ameka starts his presentation by referring to Joseph’s (1997) paper on linguistic marginalia. And then, unsurprisingly, the talk slowly shifts to ideophones and of course his old student Mark Dingemanse. While Ameka unfortunately misquotes Dingemanse’s (2011; 2012; 2019) cross-linguistic definition, what follows is a detailed case study of ideophones in the African Kwa languages he is most familiar with, Igbo and Ewe, and what we can learn from them. Ameka rightly argues for the obliteration between core vs. periphery. For the most part I agree with his approach, although I do hold some reservations about resorting to Natural Semantic Metalanguage to describe meanings. The last part of the talk is devoted to interjections, very interesting. This talk is highly recommended."

    "text": "All linguistic subfields are equal but some are more equal than others. Lexical semantics is the most equal.\n\n\n\n\nThis lecture is largely a copy of one of the basic texts that lexical semanticists should read: Geeraerts, Dirk. 2010. Theories of Lexical Semantics. One of Geeraerts’s greatest hits is the historical overview of different approaches to lexical semantics in the last 150 years or so. Highly recommended if you’re interested in this, especially because it becomes more interesting towards the end when he incorporates more recent trends that concern methodological choices that can be made when investigating words.\n\n\n\nThis presentation was relatively good. I browsed through Jackendoff’s books in the past and it is undeniable that he has had a lot of influence in the fields of morphology and lexical semantics. The main points of his talk are that 1) schemas are better than rules; and 2) (formal) syntax can learn a lot from looking at the special features of the lexicon, phrased in terms of schemas.\nThese insights are not that much of a bombshell to me, as the benefits of a schema-based approach rather than a rule-list fallacy are well-known within Cognitive Linguistics, cf. Bybee’s works since the 1980s. However, it is good that Jackendoff plays this intermediary role between formal and cognitive-functional approaches.\nOne point of concern is that Jackendoff keeps talking about how * louden and * safen do not occur in the English lexicon, but Ms Merriam Webster disagrees with that (louden and safen). Arguably, these are not super prototypical but even as a non-native speaker I had at least heard of loudening. This thus strongly suggests that maybe a usage-based approach is better than a purely intuition-based one.\nI do recommend the talk if you want to see Jackendoff and know more about his work.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhh, Formal Semantics, field that I do not understand. I liked Partee’s overview, not in the least because she is a big name in that field and has lived through most of its history. This talk succinctly summarizes a number of issues that have driven a plethora of inquiries into formal semantics, especially in the foundational stages. It was revealing, and I applaud her for stressing that formal semantics only does / can discuss a small section of natural languages (most of which are English).\nI deplore, however, that in America, this is largely seen as the only way of doing semantics (see also Geeraerts’s talk). Maybe it’s time for lexical semantics to spread further, but that may be my own bias.\nI loved her Q&A: she for instance stresses that the deep structure semantics differ across languages. She is acutely aware that formal semantics and lexical semantics are two different beasts.\nHighly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk starts out by trying to unify the worlds of formal semantics and lexical semantics, which made me feel excited. However, throughout the talk it becomes clear the paradigm she is working in is what Geeraerts refers to as Neo-Structuralist approaches to lexical semantics, which of course are somewhat relatable to the formal semantics enterprise. McNally spends a large amount of the talk on the comparison of figurative expressions of to sweep and barrar (Spanish), which I found very interesting, and I would recommend mostly this part of the talk, even though it is almost devoid of the huge – and I mean HUGE – amount of literature on metaphors as it is done in Cognitive Semantics, which I find a missed opportunity. On the other hand, during the Q&A McNally really shows a passion for semantics which is highly contagious. Good talk.\n\n\n\nThis is a pretty standard talk that gives the standard narrative of the different incarnations of generative grammar. Check it out here if that’s new for you and you feel compelled to know.\n\n\n\nThis is a talk that is focused on how indigenous peoples use language to talk about their environment. It features case studies on peoples from Vanuatu, Bolivia, Siberia, as well as other hot spots of dying languages [sad reacts only]. Interesting for me is that it starts with this discussion on botanical terms and folk terminology. Of course, such case studies played important roles in the proposal of basic level taxonomies. Linguistic knowledge is largely cultural knowledge. And that is the reason why I think that this talk belongs in the category of semantics.\nAfter this Harrison does a tour of typical topics of phrases and vocabulary that give some insight in the worldview of these peoples: flora, fauna, time (months etc.), counting systems, way-finding and orientation. It seems that Environmental Linguistics is highly compatible with Cognitive Linguistics.\nInteresting given current events in the US with waves across the globe is his discussion on strategies to decolonize linguistics:\n\nTake encyclopedic knowledge of indigenous peoples seriously.\nRespect indigenous ways of pedagogy.\nTreat consultants as co-authors, respect their intellectual property.\n\nAs a bonus, Harrison mentions the Talking Dictionaries App. Go check it out y’all.\nHighly recommended:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this talk, which is very fundamental in nature and based on Standard Average European languages, I will remember that piano trio ‘piano accompanying violin and cello (not pianos)’ is a form of onomasiological coercion."

    "text": "I was looking forward to this talk by Hilpert, having seen him present last year at ICLC 15 in Japan on Causation, Culture, and Constructional Change, click here for the handout. However, it turns out that his Abralin talk is the same talk! Now I’m happy to see it again, and also for a broader audience and his three linguistics problems, or rather, things to watch out for, are definitely something that all linguistics should take into account:\n\nFillmore’s screwdriver: our linguistic corpora do not really reflect language usage proportionately, e.g., screwdrivers (or as I had heard it before, toothbrushes) are things we use ‘daily’, yet you don’t find them that much in corpora. Or as Hilpert summarized it: Cultural features cannot be indexed by word-use frequencies.\nFlach’s grammar lesson: Word-use frequencies have to be controlled for grammatical contexts.\nthe rising sea levels of Koplenig and Müller-Spitzer: Correlations in time-series data can be spurious if they are not controlled by correlating changes, rather than absolute values.\n\nHilpert then shows a number of interesting observations and studies about the English Causative.\nProblematic in his talk are his definitions of semasiological frequency (“How often do speakers verbalize a given concept?”) and onomasiological frequency (“How often do speakers experience a given concept?”). I’m sorry but that is just wrong. Semasiology deals with the mapping from label to meaning, so its frequency asks questions about how often does a particular meaning occur with a label. For example, a word like paint, how often does the meaning PAINT A PORTRAIT occur vs. the meaning PAINT A WALL, arguably two different kinds of painting. Onomasiology, on the other hand, takes the mapping from meaning to label into account and consequently its frequency asks about how often do labels co-occur with a given meaning. For example, the meaning of FATHER that can be expressed by dad, father, papa, pops, daddy etc. It is actually quite baffling that almost a year after his talk in Japan, where this issue was also raised, his presentation still contains these issues. I hope he can improve it the next time he gives this presentation.\nI highly recommend this talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was an amazing talk. Gildea, who I was only indirectly familiar with, really knows his stuff and takes us through the well-known cases of (split) ergativity etc. to then show how diachronic comparative syntax can (and maybe should) look like. Amazing talk and highly recommended!\nDuring the Q&A he discusses Joseph’s talk (below) who stated that grammaticalization is not a process. For Gildea is absolutely is a process, driven by the mechanisms of reanalysis and analogy. I tend to agree with that as well – it’s also in the term itself: -ization indicates processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph is a quite well-known grammaticalization guy who views it as “the embedding into grammar (the taking on of grammatical status) of once-non- (or less-) grammatical phenomena”. Rather than as a process, grammaticalization is a product (result, state) of regular sound change, borrowing, and analogy (metaphorical shift in meaning). He goes through many case studies, focusing on internal reconstruction, which is making the best of imperfect data and which offers a hypothesis, trying to deduce the historical events that led to a synchronic state. Interesting case studies include one on the adverbial marker -mente/mente in Spanish (or other Romance languages) or Greek meli ‘honey’ and onoma ‘name’. In the end he links grammaticalization back to what the Neogrammarians were doing in the 19th century, which is not really new for me (that is how we were taught Linguistics 101 in Leuven), but it may be new for American-oriented linguists who typically get a lot of generative linguistics as the supposed starting point of linguistics.\nI love his Q&A as well, very informative!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another life, where I would have studied Romance languages at KU Leuven, I probably would have taken Cornillie’s classes. I really enjoyed this talk about a case study, threaten to fall (and cognates in other Western-European languages) construction that previously was argued to arise from contact with French, but which Cornillie gracefully shows to have come from Latin. Which Latin? Exactly, that is what a large chunk of this talk is about. Don’t want to spoil it for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk is kind of weird for me, because I almost had Lahousse’s class back when I did my MA in Linguistics at KU Leuven in 2014. However, because she was pregnant at the time, we had a guest lecturer, who was in direct contact with her. So we still got her course, just not taught by her. I still recognize a number of topics that we had to read about, and I worked on topics of Chinese and Japaense for my term paper.\nThis talk is recommended if you are interested in the study of a number of Romance languages and how they form a continuum. I does bother me a bit that it’s only French, Spanish and Italian, when there are all of these other languages that are in between. Maybe that would really provide an even more fine-grained continuum in the typology of Romance languages. I enjoyed the talk though.\n\n\n\nMore Romance languages! This talk shows that discourse traditions are important when doing historical linguistics.\n\n\n\nThis talk is actually a long case study of Montréal French. Sankoff and colleagues find that the auxiliary être is being replaced by avoir (insert shock face); a change in the speed of the adoption /ʀ/, coming from /r/; the replacement of the periphrastic future (aller + infinitive) to the detriment of the inflected future. Cool talk!"

He supports the idea that corpus linguistics is a methodology rather than a field, and I tend to agree with that. Corpora provide data, the theoretical conclusions that are drawn based on it depends on frameworks, fields and persuasions.\nMost of the talk is a basic overview of what phenomena you can study with corpus data (mostly COCA), how to do it. Interesting is the typical case study of the semantic change of gay. In terms of statistics, it is mostly phrased in terms of simple absolute frequencies rather than association measures. A good first step, but maybe not enough.\nGood talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk features Marianne Mithun talking about intonation units from the interaction between theory and case study. Amina Mettouchi presents a corpus that can help study prosody, with special focus on Afro Asiatic languages. Alessandro Panunzi presents yet another corpus for studying prosody.

    "text": "“The Minimalist Program is not a theory” is a mantra that is well-known within linguistics. But then, what is it?\nIn this talk Marcel den Dikken (literally: Marcel the fat one – he is not). For him, the quintessence of the Minimalist Program, after unmerging all of the principles from the Principles and Parameter program, contains five notions: Features, which need to be checked; Merge, to add stuff to the trees; Agree for feature evaluation; a notion of Locality (‘phase’); and a notion of Economy. But all of these are argued to be somewhat problematic. Note that if you aren’t used to the abbreviations of generative approaches (“GenSpeak” / “FormSpeak”?), you will find this talk to be moving too fast, as the comments also suggest.\nThe next speaker is Norbert Hornstein, who is clearly a major proponent of the Minimalist Program. He also highlights that this theoretical framework program is not a competitor to Government and Binding, but rather assumes that it is theoretically correct, only to move away from it. This was a point I didn’t really know, so it is good that this was emphasized. But what then remains is the question if Government and Biding indeed is correct. Further in the talk, there is a very long bit on some technicalities of the Merge operation. It strikes me that there is almost no language material in these talks. Almost as if the explanandum is not the data but the theory…\nThe last speaker is David Pesetsky, who shares “some impressions and anecdotes”. The Minimalist theory Program is described as exhortative speculative fiction: we are called to build this futuristic linguistic descriptive world. There are some anecdotes of the well-known core phenomena, leading Pesetsky to argue that the grammars in our heads are not constructions grammars, but follow principles and parameters. I guess it’s agree to disagree on this one then. Then there is of course the familiar “we found this in language after language, thus it must be correct”, which I have always found problematic: normally you want your scientific paradigm to be based on falsification, especially if you’re working with a minimal (pun intended) amount of data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a presentation but an interview with Pinker, famous for his The Language Instinct, a popsci book that was extremely influential in the last 20 years or so, and now infamous for the letter asking for his removal of the media expert panel of the LSA and the subsequent twitter storm (I don’t even know where to link because there is just so much). While I admire the acumen of Pinker and agree with a lot of things he found out – for instance, I love his style book (The Sense of Style) – I still disagree with many of views on language with parameters, and completely innate. A glimmer of hope shines through this talk near the end, where he advises us to become eclectic, as opposed to adhere to 1 school of thought, “because assumptions get in the way”. But of course, every theory or framework makes use of a number of assumptions; you just need to become or stay aware about them. However, this awareness is not equally present across frameworks. Recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a talk that unexpectedly liked a lot and highly recommend. Aboh’s main point is that most people are multilingual, and that our models of studying should reflect this, not just in terms of code-switching (although he devotes most of his efforts to this situation), but also in terms of familiarity with different genres etc. Also unexpected then, is that this is definitely wrapped within generative / formal linguistics, a group of frameworks I thought focuses mostly on monolingual situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nI mistakenly first categorized this as a form of Cognitive Linguistics (see Soares da Silva below), but make no mistake, Dynamic Linguistics is an offshoot of Generative Semantics. Rojas-Berscia takes us on a tour of what this framework entails. It’s interesting to see how a different approach to variation (with lects and all) than the one I’m used to plays out.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny alternative to traditional Chomskyan grammar deserves a closer look, and Seuren’s Semantic Syntax model is quite interesting, as it rejects the neo-positivist nature of the former, and does not treat syntax as a “random sentence generator”. I did not know about Semantic Syntax, but I like how it clearly includes speech acts, lexical choices etc. However, it does seem to fall into the rule-list fallacy? I need to follow up on this model. It is also quite interesting to see how Rojas-Berscia’s presentation follows this model, which makes sense in hindsight. Lastly, the Q&A is highly recommended as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, I did not know that Estonian was the only V2 language of the Uralic languages. Holmberg argues that this is because of language contact with Germans who migrated to Estonia and became dominant in the past. If you were ever curious of seeing trees made with Finnish and Estonian data, this is your chance.\n\n\n\nThis talk is what I thought Adger’s would be like. Demonte introduces the Minimalist Program, while focusing on variation and Spanish. Revealing for me, even though I think the notion of interface has it backwards: in language, it’s not a combination of different fields that has more real status; the fields are abstractions from something highly multimodal. I also think that it’s hard to study variation without quantification. In this paradigm things are phrased in terms of passing or failing a certain (syntactic) test…\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, this one is the first guest in this series of lectures on linguistics. Very surprisingly, however, this one is not about linguistics. Disappointing.\nYou can find it here."

Tbh, sometimes I think her style on her blog is a bit too unacademic, but I guess that’s the point: she wants to get people more interested in language in general, and does this through the topic of internet usage. This talk is actually wonderful and I really enjoy her passion of her research object and I wish we had more people who do the popularisation of linguistics well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a somewhat unexpected talk; I had expected Adger to go full on minimalist program on us (which I actually would have liked – I think the people that watch these Abralin lectures are presumably quite well-versed in linguistic theories), but I will never say no to conlangs. Cool talk.\n\n\n\nCrystal is a household name in the popularization of linguistics and I have enjoyed a good number of his books. This talk is a bit different than the other ones, however, in the sense that this is an interview and it is kind of linguistics-light. I do not really recommend it (read: I took one for the team), as they are somewhat prescriptivist in their positions. For example, both parties agree that social distancing is a bad term “because it’s physical distancing”. You can’t go to war with those kinds of observations.\nYou can find it here, should you be interested."

    "text": "Okay maybe the category of Anthroplogical linguistics isn’t the best term but it is a bucket category of important aspects of language and linguistics that do not readily fit with the other ones.\n\n\nThis is an interesting talk by Pirahã-famous Dan Everett. If you are into the archeology of homonids and the phenomenon of languages, this is highly recommended. There are lots of Peircean semiotics in this talk. You can find it here.\n\n\n\nNgue Um starts his presentation with the well-known trope that “you linguistics is not about speaking many languages”, by asking: Why not? Why can’t linguists be assumed to speak multiple languages? Is it “pure science” advocacy? Is it a disregard to social engagement? Is it a historical bias? Is it neoliberalism? The talk is largely focused on arguing for more sociolinguistic approaches to the ‘languaging’ in Africa, rather than purely theoretical analyses. And it is quite convincing.On the other hand, some abstraction when sciencing does remain necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk mentions languaging (see Ngue Em) and multimodality as two keyterms for a better understanding of the sociolinguistics of Africa, but Makoni then goes beyond that by identifying underlying metaphors to uncover the epistemology and ontology of such approaches, e.g., “the lay-person”. The presentation is quite hard to follow because the slides aren’t shared.\n\n\n\nI thought this talk would be on a very similar vein as the ones by Ngue Um and Makoni, but actually Lüpke treats a whole range of issues that were not touched upon before. For instance, the issue of naming a language, the cultural value of speaking many languages (more is better, except in certain cases). I would recommend this talk after the previous two to form some kind of trilogy of African multilingualism and the lessons we can learn from it.\n\n\n\nI was looking forward to seeing and hearing Aikhenvald, a well-known typologist (#evidentiality) but this talk is unfortunately delivered in Portuguese (with English powerpoints), so not really accessible to me.

I must confess that despite its importance in studies on ideophones, I never really got into it and thus just follow key findings. But I think this video showcases the importance of the multimodality in acquisition. Go see it here.\n\n\n\nThis talk was interesting for me because I finally got into what repair actually is. Basically it’s asking for clarification, with a huh?, a what?, a who? etc. These are very frequent in adult conversation. Not surprisingly, learning how to do this is an important part of acquisition, but also the adult checking up on the acquiring child is important. Clark goes into great detail on both sides of this coin. Great talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin Cognitive Linguistics, Tomasello has this status of being the acquisition guy, since he started working with usage-based data and proposed theories that make uses of schematization quite early on. I once saw a talk by him back in Leuven, which was very interesting, and have read a number of his books on acquisition, which were very insightful.\nThis talk goes further along his research axis in talking about the multimodality of acquisition, by focusing on gestures (pointing but also gaze), and comparing humans with primates. Recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk is the opposite of the body of work that Tomasello represents and I would have expected a serious alternative to Tomasello, couched in UG and Generative Grammar, to address issues that were maybe lacking in Tomasello’s work. But it’s just not there. This was not my cup of tea.\n\n\n\nThis talk looks at the acquisition from a mostly phonological point-of-view. There is some attention for Mandarin, which was particularly interesting for me, although I don’t know if I’m convinced by the idea that Mandarin infants mostly hear syllables rather than words… Check it out here.\n\n\n\nThis group talk looks at how children acquire reading skills. Important, because reading is fundamental."

She takes word frequencies as clues for further investigation and I guess that’s how it often goes: you learn a bit about something which prompts you to dig deeper. Good talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of the most important talks in this series, or at least one of the most relevant ones. DeGraff relates his talk also to the situation of Haiti.\nIn the beginning of the talk there is a screenshot with Black lives matter translated into different languages, including Chinese, where it says 「黑命无价」 hēi mìng wú jià ‘black life have.not price’, “black lives are priceless”. However, to me the negation in wú jià seems kind of negative. I would not translate it that way, even though the composite expression means ‘priceless’. Maybe a yě suàn 也算 ‘also count’ is a better way of translating? I’m curious to see other opinions.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet another great talk on the social issue that grips the world right now. It forces us to think about the white gaze (also in academia). Highly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe traditional view is that deliberate linguistic change is not something that is at all likely to have more than minor influence on a system. Thomason’s view, however, is that speakers can change anything in their language they can become aware of. What follows is a colorful display of (mostly phonological) examples of different factors that can induce deliberate change, such as: accommodation, distancing, secrecy, standardization, censure or ridicule avoidance, and identity construction.\nI particularly enjoyed her demonstrations of Salish demonstrations. Also interesting is the story behind the debate of possible pulmonic ingressives in Tsou. Thomason’s student Michael Fuller argued he found them (1990), but when Ladefoged & Zeitoun went to investigate (1993) they couldn’t find them. Thomason gives a plausible reason why the latter could not find them…\nA recommended talk!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk takes a while to get going, but it shows Labov’s eminence and longstanding status within the field of sociolinguistics. Especially in times of #BlackLivesMatter this is an important talk, because it goes in depth into AAVE.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the title of this talk I thought it would be “just another talk on the weirdness of monolingual standards”, and it is that for sure, but it’s also so much more. I think especially near the end of the talk, when Sorace starts talking about economy and efficiency I was really hooked. Note, this presentation has some technical problems of some duration, so don’t be put off by the long initial lecture time. Very good!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk, which is in Portuguese, represents the sociolinguistic approach that I’m mostly familiar with, i.e., well-grounded in Cognitive Linguistic tenets. I have been following Soares da Silva’s work in the CLR series during my PhD, and have liked many of his papers. Unfortunately this talk is in Portuguese, so I couldn’t fully enjoy it. But I hope it inspired more members of the Brazilian target audience to follow in his footsteps.\n\n\n\nI like the way Poplack has outlined ‘code-switching’, a phenomenon that is well-studied yet defined or approached in wildly different ways, in this talk. She shows that most code-switching is not composed of multiword phrases, but rather single words, and the bulk of these are established loanwords. Most of these words are content words, mostly nouns.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent talk on a number of sociolinguistic issues, mostly America-focused. Watch it here.\n\n\n\nI wanted to like this talk but it just didn’t speak to me. Check it out here."

    "text": "Grammaticalization expert Traugott discusses a number of discourse markers from a construction grammar perspective, e.g., by the way, which she analyzes brilliantly in the way that she is known for throughout her career. Curiously, she frames her study somewhat by stating that early Cognitive Linguists did not pay much attention to discourse (markers), referring to Fillmore (1988), Langacker (1987) or Goldberg (1995, 2006, 2019), and that it is odd because Sweetser (1990) talked about discourse markers. I find this a weird starting point, because it certainly is not the goal of Fillmore’s Frame semantics to talk about this phenomenon, so I don’t know why she would expect to find it there. Langacker’s Cognitive Grammar (1987) outlines the basic foundations of his theoretical apparatus, but in (2008) we find a whole section on discourse, which also has played an important part in Cognitive Grammar over the years, albeit from a introspective data approach. Goldberg’s work is also mostly focused on constructions that usually feature a verb; it seems that the discourse markers Traugott is interested in are not really of that nature. So it is strange that this is the point against which she frames her talk. BUT, a good talk nonetheless. Highly recommended!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lecture provides a decent overview of issues related to studying discourse from a Cognitive Linguistics perspective. I disagree with the starting point (also in the abstract) that states that “On-line phenomena, such as discourse processes unfolding in real time, can and should be explored from a cognitive perspective as well” (emphasis mine). Already in the second book in the CLR series, scholars have been dealing with issues like activation, reference etc. That is not to say that that treatment was sufficient – it was not – but we should also not pretend that CL has never looked at discourse. Recommended talk.\n\n\n\nThis talk focuses mostly on the utterances and information units. It features examples with special prosody that are very reminiscent of a certain fellow student of mine… Find the talk here."

I have made use of his research in my research, especially when making the important distinction between cross-linguistics comparative concepts and language-particular categories. In this talk this is called the difference between g-linguistics and p-linguistics. This talk is about parallels between biology and linguistics, focusing on how evolutionary adaptation as an important factor for explaining phenomena. In biology such explanations are quite common, but in linguistics they are not. It is a good talk and recommended, although I remain skeptical about many of the issues raised during the Q&A and Haspelmath’s adaptability in terms of explanations.\nKind of weird is that there are lots of references to Haspelmath (2021) and Haspelmath (2021a). Did he come back from the future? Also weird is Haspelmath’s lumping together of Chomsky (1965) and Jackendoff (2002) with Langacker (1987) under the heading of complete bio-cognitive explanations of so-called p-languages, as opposed to cultural explanations or comparison with other languages (g-language). I think Cognitive Grammar, while focusing on cognition, is very much compatible with cultural types of explanation and tries to uncover a number of important features of language usage in general. This lumping together seems unwarranted.\n\n\n\n\n\nI like this kind of thinking, where efficiency factors are studied in the production and reception of language usage; it’s very attractive, and I think it needs to become more widespread. This talk fits in well with a Cognitive Linguistics approach to sounds, although I’m not sure Wedel would see it like that as well. One interesting finding mentioned in this talk is that earlier segments have a higher cue validity than later segments, which we also know from other studies, but which can also be demonstrated with predictive text when texting. But of course, it also depends on how unique certain combinations are, I guess. And that is where the end of the talk goes towards: less probable words tend to have more segments (as in Zipf’s work), but less predictable words also have segments that more quickly distinguish them from competitors. I am quite curious if I can integrate some of the insights of this talk into my research on ideophones."

I think the main point is that ‘pidgin’ is a very British colonization kind of term; while there was no Pidgin Portuguese, Pidgin French or Pidgin Dutch. The talk reminded me of Nicholas Ostler’s Empires of the Word: A language history of the world, which discusses the language policies of colonizers and colonized across time. Of course, Mufwene tells a story that ties in closer to current research into the emergence of the terms ‘pidgin’ and ‘creole’ and does so convincingly.\nI recommend this talk:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis talk presents a more traditional view of pidgins and creoles, compared to Mufwene’s talk, but does make the main basic (and correct) claim that creoles are real languages (not just mixed languages). Good!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I went into this talk with a negative view of McWhorther, stemming from my bad experiences with his The Language Hoax (see academic review here) and hearing him on other platforms where I often find myself disagreeing with many of his opinions because the logic often seems flawed (at least in the moment). However, I did like this talk. McWhorter mainly advocates against the idea that creoles are just mixtures of languages (‘uniformitarianism’), positions advanced by Mufwene and DeGraff. Instead, they come into being by converging some features of the donor languages, mediated by the effects of adult acquisition and the creation of non-native pidgins. Later in the talk he argues both that the genesis process of two languages (Tok Pisin and Sranan) is the same, even though we don’t have any historical traces of the pidgin stage of Sranan. The way he presents it is at most a conjecture, not a full deduction, so this is a weak point in his talk for me. But then later he addresses the issue of representativeness: how representative is the well-known case of Haitian creole for different creole languages, and I think that amounts to asking a very important question to which I don’t have an answer, but one that apparently should be answered asap in that field. Unlikely recommended."

The main contributions of this talk / her program are that 1. brain regions that support language processing are selective for language (as opposed to supporting other abilities, e.g., music, arithmetic); 2. brain regions that support word meanings vs. syntactic processing are the same; 3. the primary driver of the language regions’ responses is semantic composition (and not structure building).\n\n\n\n\n\nI am not well-versed in the world of neuro- /psycholinguistics but I do enjoy the presentations that have found their way to me in the past few years.

    "text": "As I’m about to do the final revisions on my dissertation, I have started reminiscing about my PhD trajectory. I envision myself writing a trilogy (or tetralogy) of posts that span the last 1.5 years of my candidature. Welcome to part 1, #dissertating, which takes us from ca. January 2019 to ca. October 2019. Part 2 can be found here.\nMany pictures below, pinky promise.\n\nPreliminary steps\nBut actually we need to go back even further in time, to the eventful day when I got my acceptance letter all the way in April 2015 (has it really been that long?!). I remember being happy that I got to go back to Taiwan after having attended a summer school here, but also a bit anxious. I found myself sitting on a train in Belgium (so you know I had spare time) and started to review the steps needed to complete the program that I was yet to begin.\nThe degree requirements included 27 credits, of which 3 (= 1 course) was required and 24 elective. Furthermore, of the 24, 12 need to be in your major (phonology & morphology, syntax, semantics & pragmatics, applied linguistics, or computational linguistics), and 6 in a minor of the same group. I eventually majored in semantics and pragmatics with a minor in applied linguistics, although it’s actually also pretty computational. It’s just a matter of semantics (ha!).\nThis step of credits takes about two to three years to complete, and I enjoyed classes so I just kept taking them throughout the years. What I did find out quite soon after starting my first semester in which I took 15 credits was that this was a form of hybris – one credit was heavier here than it had been in Leuven, where one year standard is comprised of 60 credits. Oopsie. But we survived.\nThe next, and actually even harder part, is the publication (technically acceptance) of two papers (in reputable journals / books). This is also known as the QPPQ (Qualifying Papers of Publishable Quality). I completed this at the end of June 2018 and subsequently was transformed into a Candidate. (Ask me for my papers on Chinese expressions related to the weather and iconicity, or on a historical advance of different written forms of ideophones if you are interested and cannot access it.)\nAll the while doing this, i.e., when I was waiting for reviews, I tried to attend a minimum of two international conferences per year. I’ve performed 15 different oral presentations and posters now (12-3 split). Other than this, I worked on consolidating the database (project) that would form the backbone of my dissertation, organizing our home conference (ICPEAL-)CLDC in 2019, and writing my dissertation, which I envisioned as a good, thick standalone work that nevertheless has the potential to become different papers. The unfortunate/fortunate result is that I have a number of papers that are waiting to be written up (from my conferences) but still haven’t. I currently envision a Fall where I do that from the comfort of home, while distancing socially.\n\n\n#dissertating, part 1\nAfter the conference ended I rushed to the writing board to continue the development of my thesis. Because the next step in the program at NTU is called the Proposal. This is actually not so much a full proposal as more of an outline of what you plan to do. Hmmm, writing it out like this makes it seem very similar, but there is a difference: proposal sounds more preliminary (?).\nI won’t bore you with all the details, but if you are interested, here are the slides of what my plan looked like at the time. I wrote about 80 pages of manuscript to illustrate this.  I passed it and at least that stage was over. Here is a picture of my committee and me after the event.\n\n\nAfter some soul searching next to the Drunken Moon Lake on campus, I tried to analyze the five directions I was being pulled in. Some examples of things they wanted me to do: add more examples, arrange things chronologically (instead of thematically), add genre effects, look at phonesthemes in the phonology but also radicals, do sound symbolism, add more details about the code without writing the actual code, leave things that I couldn’t explain behind, leave acquisition out of the research in the dissertation, add more Chinese papers and so on. There were also a few thinking questions: 1) what is the scope of ‘ideophone’ in Chinese? 2) what is the story of your dissertation?\nAnd finally there were two questions / comments that I could not answer because I just did not expect them at all. The first of these was the methodological question pertaining to ALL SEMANTIC STUDIES. It went like this: We have dictionaries, so why would we even need semantic studies?? And I just stood there with my mouth full of teeth, unable to reply, because this question touches upon the foundation of all of semantics. Why would you even need to do linguistic research. We have dictionaries, isn’t that enough? (Send your answers to me.)\nThe second one was a comment: encyclopedic knowledge is not important for linguistics. I am sorry but I couldn’t can’t even. Especially for a topic like ideophones, rooted in usage, encyclopedic knowledge is everything. In that moment I realized I was living in a linguistics universe different from that committee member.\n\n\nThat being said, I was grateful for their comments (despite what the picture above may suggest). I guess more debate is better than no debate. It just isn’t fun when it happens when you’re trying to defend a proposal. So, yeah, the task was up to me to decide how to stretch when being pulled in all these different directions (figure for illustration).\n\n\n\n#vacationing\nLuckily, after the defense, I had allowed myself some time off. You know how Chinese culture countries have a super long winter break? I wanted to take some time off by visiting my friend Arthur in Hong Kong and my other friend Guillermo in Beijing.\n\nPictures of Hong Kong (and Macau)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPictures of Beijing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really felt recharged after this trip and ready to start working on the many questions that were awaiting me.\n\n\n\n#CHIDEOD\nAfter coming back, I worked hard, with periodic consultations with Arthur, on my Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD). We presented it at the ILL Conference in 2019 in Lund (Sweden). But in doing so, I leveled up my coding. I find that it’s often the case that you work hard on a piece of data, which then gives you further inspiration on how to analyze it, or try to approach it. So there were the basic analyses that can be performed with CHIDEOD, but as an open source dataset, it is also meant to be plugged in into corpora, and be used in the design of experiments, or to guide in the creation of surveys, and can even serve as a checklist for more introspective approaches.\nSo in May we went to Sweden, to do the presentation. Here are some photos of that research (but also fun) trip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I got to meet my mum in Denmark as well!!\n\n\n\n\nI really got a big amount of inspiration from the conference (find our presentation here). For instance, I got to know more about Bodo Winter’s experimental and survey work on sensory linguistics, got to know the brilliant and brilliantly funny Bonnie McLean, got to rub shoulders again with Mark Dingemanse, got to see well-known names from the literature in the flesh, got to learn about the exciting work that is being done. Yeah, it was good. I especially enjoyed the round table about what iconicity is. I think Mark summed it up pretty well: “Iconicity is in the eye of the beholder”.\nOnce back in Taipei I started preparing my conferences for the summer: an invited talk in Nagoya, two talks at ICLC in Nishinomiya (and later on also co-hosting a session). I worked (again) through Natalia Levshina’s book How to do linguistics with R and with the data in place I finally knew what needed to be done to investigate the scope of my data: Multiple Correspondence Analysis. So, should you ever see this, thank you Natalia.\n\n\n#Byebye classmates\nThe Spring semester of 2019 was also the time where most of the remaining classmates that started out with me all those years ago (in the MA program) finally graduated. That plus three senior students, Taco, Chester and Simon, who graduated as freshly-minted PhDs from the GIL at NTU. I was really sad to see most of them go, e.g., Greg, Richard, Nina, Caridee, Naiwen, and of course CJ. I hope that you’ve done well in the past year so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#BelgianReconnections\nIn 2019 I also got to reconnect with a Belgian professor of Taiwan studies here, Ann Heylen. I got to work with her on a newspaper project that investigated how Taiwan (Formosa) was reported on in different media venues.\n\n\nBut I was also visited by Nicolas Standaert in the summer, one of my professors when I studied Chinese at KU Leuven.\n\n\nAnd later in the year I got the opportunity to meet (and invite) my old MA thesis advisor Willy Vande Walle here in Taipei.\n\n\nI want to thank all of them for their advice and the pleasant talks.\n\n\n#Japan\nAfter saying goodbye to the classmates, I got to go to Japan. The plan was simple: I would go first and do my invited talk in Nagoya’s Nanzan University, arranged by the ever so friendly Kimi Akita and Keiko Murasagi. Then I would solo travel and start my Cognitive Linguistics conference. And then CJ would join me and we would conquer the west of Japan, by railpass. I know that most of you have seen these pictures, which I selectively spread out from August till December on instagram, but I am still going to share my favorite pics here as well. #sorrynotsorry.\n\nNagoya and Nara\nSo in Nagoya I presented on the use of Multiple Correspondence Analysis in relation to CHIDEOD data, click here for the slides. After the valuable feedback from the audience I got to go to Nara, with Bonnie “I am doing the classic swing by Japan on my way from Australia to Europe shortcut” McLean and her boyfriend John Huisman, as well as an expert on Munda ideophones, Maki (if I remember correctly – it’s been almost a year). Finally I got to make my dream come true of feeding the deer (and being harassed by them), as well as soaking up the ancient athmosphere that still lingers in that ancient capital of Japan. I loved it. Then, I couldn’t be more surprised to find out my friend Takeshita ‘Zhúxià’ Mai, who was my classmate when I was abroad in Suzhou, lives close to Nara. Naturally, we met up and I had a great night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNishinomiya\nAfter Nara it was time to attend ICLC, the biggest Cognitive Linguistics conference out there, this time held in Nishinomiya (close to Osaka). It was great to reconnect with some other old professors of mine, like Dirk Geeraerts, but also friend-scholars from all around the globe. And I was kind of proud that our institute had quite a big delegation, I think about 8 people, so well done, us. Go tigers! (What is the mascotte of NTU, I have no idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slides for my first presentation on how to study Chinese ideophones historically with semantic vector spaces can be found here.. The remarks of the audience kind of confirmed my way of thinking, but had a few critical notes that I later on tried to resolve.\nThe other presentation looked at how Chinese infants and kids acquired onomatopoeia and reduplications, and how they use them in an intersubjective manner. Crucially we used the childesr package, which is a mirror of the CHILDES corpora, but standardized in nice and clean R instead of idiosyncratic CHAT code. The slides can be found here.\n\n\nWest-Japan with CJ\n¡Ay díos mio! my trip with CJ to Japan’s west was simply the best. I will try to make it kind of brief.\nWe went to Himeji castle, Japan’s most famous castle. Next to it there is also a fabulous garden, Kōko-en, do visit it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were based in Okayama, because it was kind of central on our railpass itinerary. But it also turns out that Okayama also has this beautiful famous garden, Kōraku-en.\n\n\nThen later we went to Miyajima, to see the famous floating torii in the Itsukushima shrine. Unfortunately, the torii itself was under renovation (in preparation for the 2020 Olympics that are postponed), but we still got some really nice views and I loved the place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext on the trip was a meeting with one of my best friend of my Suzhou days: Ishii Yuya. I hadn’t seen him in so long but was really thrilled to have reconnected with him and seeing that he’s doing well. He lives in Shikoku, so he graciously offered us a tour of Marugame and Takamatsu. In the former we got to enjoy his dad’s noodles (美味しかったです) and the most amazing view of the main island; in the latter we went to another famous garden Ritsurin kōen and to a local festival. As can be seen, I like kimonos and yukatas a lot. I think they thought it was 面白い that a 外国人 was interested in their outfits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext was Hiroshima, a city that does not need any introduction. I loved the vibe though in the city. Naturally we visited the Dome and the atomic bomb museum, which were very moving.\n\n\nAfter this trip the weather started turning and we kind of fled from Okayama (where we stayed) to our next stop, Kyōto. But what a beauty Kyōto is. I can totally understand why my advisor studied there. I liked Tōkyō, but I think I fell in love with Kyōto (or maybe even more Hiroshima). There are temples EVERYWHERE, and I really liked the older districts. A very select number of pictures of the many we took below, including the Golden Pavilion, the Burning character festival, the Inari shrine,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ever feel the need to see more Japan pictures, I am always available. Unfortunately, we now must turn to the inevitable part of this report.\n\n\n\n#InMemoriam\nAs we were enjoying Japan, having reconnected with so many friends and teachers from around the world, I got a message from my family near the end of our trip. My grandfather (‘opa’) Theo Venckeleer, eminent scholar of Medieval French (see here) had been hospitalized for the last time. Luckily I still got to videochat with him, but it became clear quite fast that there wouldn’t have been a way to go back in time to Belgium to just hold his hand and say the last goodbyes. Even writing this now it still pains my heart to think that this linguistics scholar, who had always supported me, especially in my own scholarly career, was now fading away, even much so that in the end he could only say yes and no but still understood everything – it just wouldn’t come out (Broca’s aphasia). One of my biggest regrets is not finishing my PhD in time for him to see me become a doctor.\nI still remember being in Osaka, having heard the news, and just basically fleeing to the laundromat around the corner, to write a letter to him, in order to underscore how much he has meant to me. My mom read the letter to him, and he still understood it, but it is unfortunately no subsitute for his presence. Later during the funeral, they also read the letter out loud. Should you be particularly interested, here is the link. I am putting it here mostly for my future self.\n\n\n\n\n#SeeYaCJ\nSaying goodbye to Opa was pretty hard, but saying goodbye to CJ was maybe even harder, because he had become such an integral part of my life. Oh no, CJ didn’t kick any buckets, he got into the Linguistics PhD program at UC Santa Barbara and I couldn’t have been prouder. Unfortunately, it also meant that he had to go to the US. Here is us saying goodbye.\n\n\nI am not going to lie, it was hard being here without him, even with all the videochatting possiblities that the current world has to offer. And the time difference. Urgh. When I went to bed, he just woke up; and he went to bed in my afternoon. There was never a moment where our day was finished at remotely the same time – this whole semester felt like one stretched out day. Luckily he came back in December, but that’s for the next installment in this series.\n\n\n#dissertating, part 2\nNow I still need to turn #dissertating in the Fall semester of 2019. I had a hard time, not in the least because of my losses (yes plural, read the preceding two paragraphs). So I felt kinda lonely, even though there were of course moments I felt happy momentarily, especially when friends came to visit me. But there was just this DISSERTATION looming over my shoulder, a lot of “you should be writing” guilt, and maybe some general ennui as well.\nI started teaching English conversation to BA2 at Tatung University, tried to balance a few grant applications, a research project with my advisor, another project with Ann (see above), reworking my database and on and on and on and on and on and on I went, and I really felt like I was going on my own, pretending he’s beside me, all alone…. Nevertheless, I did make strides forward in my research, it’s just sometimes – and I’m pretty sure this happens to all scholars – you just don’t see it for yourself. I got a lot of good tips and inspiration from Tara Brabazon’s youtube channel which I like watching, even now. But yeah, it was a dreadful time.\nSo there you have it, almost a complete year report. It started out kind of anxious, with the Proposal. But then there were lots of good events and I felt accomplished, enjoying a moderately healthy work-life balance.\n\nFire Nation Avatar GIF from Firenation GIFs\n\n\nBut then, everything changed in the second half of the year and the #dissertating became #struggling. Just so you know, things turned out well. I am ending on a down note here, but we’re going up again in the next blog post."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is part two in my series that comprises the last 1.5 years of my candidature in linguistics at NTU. The first part, #dissertating, can be found here. This installment will take us from the emotional depths of the abyss I found myself in ca. October 2019 to the top of the world, when I passed my PhD defense and graduated about a week later. Get ready for an emotional rollercoaster. Or just scroll through to the defense if that is your fancy.\nThe title of this blog comes from one of my favorite Tara Brabazon lectures, entitled “How to fail a PhD in 60 seconds”, where it is argued that PhD examination is a Dark Art. And as we know from Harry Potter, we need to defend ourselves against the Dark Arts. In the context of a PhD that means writing a good dissertation and presenting it well enough to pass.\n\n#struggling\nAround October last year I found myself kind of lost after the loss of my grandfather and with CJ in the States. I was making progress with my work, but I felt quite isolated. Here is a picture for illustration of my spirit animal back then. Put this song on in the background as you let linger here for a while.\n\n\nLuckily I had moments of light in my life, like friends hitting me up to hang out, or friends from overseas that came to visit me. So here are some pictures in which I felt happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want to say thank you for providing light in the dark.\n\n\nOnce upon a December\nI couldn’t wait until December rolled around, when CJ would come back and we would go to Hong Kong for one of his best friends’ wedding. It was simply amazing. Congratulations Ka and Mona!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in Taiwan the biggest event was the 25th anniversary of our Graduate Institute of Linguistics. I did feel excited and proud to be part of it. In hindsight I look back with good memories to my time here. Even though I also felt the end coming nearer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe writing winds of winter\nUnfortunately UCSB called CJ back (okay okay, he is pursuing a degree there) on New Year’s Day, so life turned bleak again. It was at this time also that we started hearing first signs of a virus in Wuhan. As the days progressed, Taiwan started closing the borders with the mainland, but kept other places still open. The timing was not too bad: winter holiday was upon us.\nI used these stretches of time to finalize chapter 7 in my dissertation, and was happily surprised when Arthur and David came to visit me. We did about a week of writing bootcamp while they were here and that accountability really pushed me forward, so much so that by February I felt finished “for now”. Thanks for the staycation guys.\n\n\n\n\n#dissertating, part 3\nAs the world slowly began to feel the effects of COVID19 (and Taiwan was spared), I was still distancing socially, locking myself in one of the rooms at my department. It was once again a period in which I mostly felt down because of reasons I can only explain face to face. But here is another picture that captures the emotion perfectly.\n\n\nHowever, a flame was kindled in myself, and I just wanted to see it through. This involved going over my work again and again, trying to spot every typo or weird logic. I am thankful to my mom and CJ for helping me in this process and also other people who will discover their names in the acknowledgments (I mean I have to build some suspense right?).\n\n\nSlowly life began to have color again as the dissertation reached the threshold of sendable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was not in small part due to the coronavirus. One of the negative effects was that it seemed impossible for my parents to come to Taiwan during my defense. But it was nice that CJ also fled the unsafe States (like seriously, what is going on there) to safe Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\nMay the beginning of the end\nI was leaving my building one day and realized it would soon be over. So I had to take a picture of the building while I still could.\n\n\nAnd luckily after what felt like an eternity of bleakness, dread and sorrow, I finally got to arrange my final committee, who were able to accommodate my defense within a short amount of time. So I am forever grateful for that.\nIn any case, I became a father of my intellectual brainchild.\n\n\nI sent off my dissertation and about three weeks later I did my defense. And now I’ve finally taken the time to turn the main presentation in a youtube video, because our defenses are all public – which I think is a good thing. Maybe open science should start by opening up all the defense presentations. So today I finally finished the subtitles, because the video is noisy at times. Here it is, for you to enjoy.\n\n\nMy presentation lasted about 30 minutes but this was followed by some 90 minutes of defending and Q&A. I also have those files on camera, but I have not yet felt the need to make those public. Contact me if you think it would significantly (I’m talking p &lt; 0.05 significant) improve your life to see those files.\nI am glad to say that I passed it with A+ – still not sure what that entails, but I’m sure that’s a good thing. And here I am looking thrilled with my committee.\n\n\nWhile my Proposal defense had felt like a bit of a letdown, this really felt good. I enjoyed talking about my research (even though I sound super nervous in the video in the beginning) and trying to answer the questions to the best of my abilities. And later I got to celebrate and live maybe a bit too deliciously for one evening.\n\n\nGraduation\nMaybe one of the most extraordinary things of being in Taiwan in times of COVID19 is that in the end, I got to have an in-the-flesh defense as well as an in-the-flesh graduation ceremony. Once again, so sorry that my parents couldn’t be here, but luckily this was also recorded and could be watched online. I enter the picture from about 6:52.\n\n\nHere are even more pictures of me wearing the gown (what we call ‘toga’ in Dutch).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo yes, everything turned out well. I don’t care how long you’ve been on this journey with me, thank you all for being there for me, from my parents to my partner, to my family, to my friends I made along the way, old friends, friends that came to visit me, friends that wished they visit me, my committee, my professors, my friends at school and outside of it, colleagues that have inspired me, people I had the honor of meeting at conferences, and not in the least to my advisor for advising me. I have enjoyed being here in Taiwan and am hoping that once I leave it won’t be the last time I see everybody.\nThe next installment in this series is planned for the end of August, after I “leave school” (離校), i.e., turn in my dissertation. But I probably will make some more posts in between.\nThomas out."

    "text": "Finally, the paper I wrote together with Arthur Lewis Thompson on the Chinese Ideophone Database is out! Get your copy now at Cahiers de Linguistique Asie Orientale (or by contacting us).\n\nVan Hoey, Thomas & Arthur Lewis Thompson. 2020. The Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD). Cahiers de linguistique Asie orientale 49(2). 136–167. https://doi.org/10.1163/19606028-bja10006.\n\n\nWhat is CHIDEOD?\nCreatively abbreviated as CHIDEOD, the Chinese Ideophone Database aims to collect ideophone types (as opposed to tokens — it’s not a corpus!) as found in dedicated studies and dictionaries.\nFrom the abstract:\n\nThis article introduces the Chinese Ideophone Database (chideod), an open-source dataset, which collects 4948 unique onomatopoeia and ideophones (mimetics, expres- sives) of Mandarin, as well as Middle Chinese and Old Chinese. These are analyzed according to a wide range of variables, e.g., description, frequency. Apart from an overview of these variables, we provide a tutorial that shows how the database can be accessed in different formats (.rds, .xlsx, .csv, R package and online app interface), and how the database can be used to explore skewed tonal distribution across Mandarin ideophones. Since chideod is a data repository, potential future research applications are discussed.\n\n\n\nWhat is it good for?\nIt is our aim that this database can help us to better delineate and understand Chinese ideophones. With a cross-linguistic definition of “marked words that depict sensory imagery and which belong to an open lexical class” (Dingemanse 2019) we can investigate how and to what exant types recorded in this database map onto that necessarily vague and encompassing definition.\nIn my dissertation, I have a chapter that does exactly this. By exploring different parameters (morphological template, orthograpic reduplication, sensory imagery) one can already sketch a more detailed picture of what “the Chinese ideophonic lexicon” looks like.\nBut there’s more. CHIDEOD contains a number of psycholinguistically informative variables on the characters that make up Chinese ideophones, taken from the amazing Chinese Lexical Database (Sun et al. 2018), which can help one design experiments.\nThen there’s also the corpus component: the complete list of ideophone types or a subset thereof can be run on a corpus to extract sentences / utterances containing ideophones. A straightforward usage is investigating the interplay between ideophones and constructions (see my dissertation).\nAnd of course, for typological questions this database is quite useful. We incorporated reconstructed pronuncations of items (based on the Baxter-Sagart system), which can be compared to other ideophonic forms in the region, or inform us about sound symbolism (see Smith 2015 for an in-depth but limited case study of sound symbolism in the Shījīng).\n\n\nWhat CHIDEOD doesn’t do\nIt’s a misconception that CHIDEOD is a corpus. As such, it does not contain any KWIC (keyword in context) information, or token frequencies; because if you’re interested in that, all you have to do is plug the list into a corpus to extract that information.\nAs of yet, there is no multimodal data involved, like pictures of videoclips, like there is for the Multimedia Encyclopedia of Japanese Mimetics (MEJaM) or the Quechua realwords.\nAnd on a third note, perhaps somewhat weirdly, it does not contain information about the “ideophonicity” or “iconicness” of these items, simply because that information is not out there yet (if you have this data and want us to incorporate it, please get in touch). There is also some debate going on about the validity of such ratings at the moment as well, so I am kind of holding off at the moment though.\n\n\nWhere can I get CHIDEOD?\nThis is perhaps what I’m most proud of. We’ve built a database that is freely accessible and can be used for non-commercial purposes.\nYou can find the OSF repository of CHIDEOD here and its accompanying github repository here.\nThe OSF repository contains versioned updates on the database, which can be obtained in .rds, .csv, and .xlsx.\nBut there is also the app version, which lets you select the variables you’re interested in and export them to the clipboard, CSV or Excel.\nThen, for the R-minded interested parties, you can also get it in an R package by running the following command:\n\nlibrary(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"simazhi/chinese_ideophone_database/CHIDEOD\")\n\n\n\nFinal tips and tricks\nWhen using the database in code, it is recommended to run a command like dplyr::distinct() or unique() on subsets, as the data is stored in a reasonably tidy way, which means many values get repeated once you start subsetting.\nAlso we recommend keeping traditional or simplified in the mix when you start subsetting, so as to avoid erroneously taking homophones for the same word.\nLastly, we advise that you read the companion article in CLAO thoroughly.\n\n\nGot questions?\nIf you are interested in using this database but are unsure of how or what can mean for you in your research, do not hesitate to get in touch, we will try to help you to the best of our abilities.\nIf you spot an error (errare humanum est), be sure to let us know as well; we will try to fix it in a next update.\nIf you have data that is compatible with this database, or want tips and tricks for making your own database like this, I also welcome you."

    "text": "I’ve been settling in at my new job at the Language Development Lab at HKU, which I started physically in March 2021. I will soon do an update on my time in Hong Kong since then, but this post is written with future me in mind. A big part of my job is to work out the practical implementations of experiments, and that has thus far involved managing the project structure, designing psychopy experiments, and post-experiment analysis in R. This seems like a nice trilogy of technical posts, and I hope to deliver to you (and future me). Today’s special on the menu is automating the set-up of a project.\n\nWhy worry about this\nMost people that are not very code minded have a vague idea of what a folder on their computer should look like and will let the structure of the subfolders automatically emerge. Perhaps you tell yourself you will remember which version is the “real final one” and that some of the figures are in that other folder somewhere else on your computer in that one powerpoint slide and that some data can be found under a rock, if you look closely, and oh no it was not the final version after all and you need to make some changes so you add a date, then go find some more data and then remember that maybe if you change a little bit here and there it might be a better version but it’s on the same date, so now it’s today’s date but with an ‘a’ behind it so you will remember and then you’re kinda sure it’s the final-final version so you save it but when you come back next week it turns out there is an even finaler version but then luckily you’re finished.\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nYou come back to that document because there was something in it and luckily you still have all versions on your computer but which version is “the real final version”? Joost might know it. All you find is the following structure:\n\nAnd even though the post this picture was featured on lists some great tips to avoid the most important versioning issues – I am also privy to using DATE extensions when working with other people in MS Word, e.g., “paperstudy_20210512.docx” – the burden can be alleviated by using a version control system like github. I’ve done that for my dissertation and it has been very useful to retrieve older sections, but it did make revisions and comments from my supervisor, who preferred MS Word, more difficult, as we had to settle on PDF and the comment system there. There is less friction with the track-changes and comment functions in MS Word than with PDF, but I think I would still prefer a versioning system.\nAnyway, an organically grown folder structure may be clear in the moment, but your future self will curse you, or even worse, hex you. The answer to avoiding a lot of future project pain is having a structure that is easy to set up, and is flexible to suit a particular project’s needs.\n\n\nBest practices\nJust googling for something like ‘R project structure best practices’ will result in a number of very interesting blogs that advocate what a project folder could should look like. For instance, Nice R Code shows that a good project layout ensures the integrity of the data, the portability of the project, and the support for the future usage. There’s also Krista Destasio’s best practices in R or an example directory structure on Very statisticious. For me, the importance of having a decent structure kicked in about 1.5 years ago, when I did a massive overhaul of my dissertation folder after seeing Jenny Bryan talk about project-oriented workflows, and I wished I had started with a clear structure from the beginning. And now I can’t really see myself not making a somewhat clear structure from the beginning.\nSo what does my own best practice look like? It will be something close to the structure in this screenshot (which I will be building in today’s post, so stay tuned for that).\n\nAs you can see I have quite a number of folders and files, from the getgo. First there is the Rproj file (here ABB.Rproj). This ensures I can use my project-oriented workflow and keep track, and also connect the code to github if I so desired and I usually desire so.\nNext is the README.md file, a typical file in which you write important information you want other people to read. This is a useful piece of documentation, but if you’re not into filling that out in the beginning that’s okay too; it doesn’t take up much space lol.\nOur first folder is the data/ folder, which has two subfolders: data/raw/ and data/processed/. The main idea is that the raw/ folder contains original data you bring to the analysis, while the processed/ folder acts as a dumping ground for intermediate data files, not necessarily output. The processed/ folder is a quite new structure for me, so I don’t know if I’m going to keep it around.\nThen we have the documents/ folder, which should contain supporting documents, maybe some crucial papers, or a figure that’s important for the argument.\nNext figures/ will eventually contain figures generated by code or in powerpoint, or whatever fancy software you wish to use, like photoshop. It’s useful to have this as a separate folder because some journals will ask you to submit the figures separately.\nThen there are the notes/, a place for random notes and observations.\nThere is output/, which ideally consists of the output data that will see the light of day in a repository, cleaned and ready for analysis. In my conception, that means that output/ can also contain data to be read in again in a final representation of the script.\nNext we have paper/. This is where I keep different versions of the paper, ideally coded with a date as mentioned above.\nThere is the previous/ folder, in which I will periodically move older versions of the paper we don’t need in the moment but may want to keep around just a little bit longer. It also acts as a kind of bin, tbh.\nAnd finally there is the scripts/ folder, in which I would store all .R, .Rmd and .py or what have you files.\nNote that this structure is completely flexible and is bound to change for every project. For instance, there may be a replication component, so it is good to have a separate folder for stimuli or figures from that paper (perhaps under documents/ but hey, you do you boo). Or if you have an experiment, like I find myself these days with Psychopy, that inevitably comes with a psychopy/ folder.\nSo, are we good on the idea that 1) it is beneficial to work with projects? and 2) the initial project structure should something like the picture above? Okay, time to move on to the next step: workflow and automation.\n\n\n1) Version control - github\nI think it is clear by now that in most cases I would advocate for a version controlled project. That usually means I would start on Github to create a new project, as such:\n\nThen fill out the information for your new project. I like to start with a private repository, but that’s up to you. I would suggest adding the README file and also a .gitignore.\n\nAfter the project is started, if you’re on a Mac, go to the .gitignore dotfile and add the following to that file and save it. This will make sure that the very annoying .DS_Store files that a reviewer commented on in the past, won’t show up in the project. (What are .DS_Store files anyway and why do they keep appearing????)\n# .DS_Store\n.DS_Store\nOkay, now you’re all set for step 2.\n\n\n2) Version control - local\nNow, open Rstudio, and create a new project.\n\nNext, click on version control with git:\n\nFill out the details and open in new session:\n\nIf you don’t want to use github or a similar hub or lab for doing version control, I would at least do it locally. In that case you choose “New Directory” (recommended) or “Existing Directory” (not recommended) for making the folder with its Rproj file.\n\n\n3) Add the folder structure\nNow you have something like this (I turned on the normally invisible dotfiles like .gitignore so you can see their presence):\n\nQuite barren, isn’t it. Now comes the trick to avoid having to manually make new folders.\nClick on ABB.Rproj (or whatever you named your project folder, followed by .Rproj). This will open up Rstudio. Make a new script or Rmarkdown file and run the following code:\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(fs)\n\ndir_create(here(\"data\", \"raw\"))        # raw data\ndir_create(here(\"data\", \"processed\"))  # intermediate data\ndir_create(here(c(\"scripts\",           # storing all .R, .Rmd, .py files\n                  \"figures\",           # output figures\n                  \"output\",            # output files\n                  \"previous\",          # previous versions keep for record\n                  \"paper\",             # current versions of the document\n                  \"notes\",             # random notes\n                  \"documents\"          # supporting documents\n                  )\n                )\n           )\nVoilà, the structure has been generated in the right way.\n\n\nThoughts on here and fs\nI cannot stress how important the anchor of Rproj files has been to my workflow, whether or not I actually run code for a particular project. In the not so distant past, R code usually would start with lines like the following to make sure you’re in the right working directory (getwd() and setwd()).\n# mac\nsetwd(\"C:/Thomas/dropbox/here/is/my/unique/folder\")\n# windows\nsetwd(\"C:\\\\Thomas\\\\dropbox\\\\here\\\\is\\\\my\\\\unique\\\\folder\")\n\nrm (list=ls())\nLuckily, we were warned not to do so by Jenny Bryan.\n\nAnd even luckierly, we can just make sure there is an Rproj file in our project folder, and then use the here package to have a transportable folder that will work both on Windows and Mac (and I guess Linux?) to navigate the structure of folders and files.\nThe fs package is a better version for managing paths and directories than Base R. The first function (in combination with here) that I find myself using a lot is:\ndatalist &lt;- fs::dir_ls(here(\"data\", \"subfolder_with_lots_of_files\"),\n                       regexp = \".csv$\",\n                       recurse = TRUE)\nThis will get you a vector of all .csv files you want to loop over, and it is easy to write and to remember.\nThe second function that I like helped me draw the diagram of the folder structure given above:\ndir_tree(here())\nYes, it was that simple to make that figure.\nAnyways, future me and other readers for who this is helpful, now I have a place to come copy the code chunk for generating the project setup and also a record of my current best practice of starting a project.

However, they are not the same: TextObject has many more variables you can set, like having a border around your text object (which is pretty crucial in my opinion). While TextObject, at the time of writing, has a small ‘beta’ sticker on top of it, it appeared to me as the new and improved text stimulus go-to. One of the main benefits of TextObject is that the text can be editable, i.e., they can act as small forms. (I don’t know what they did before this function, since that seems pretty crucial??)\nBut, as the image shows, using TextObject for non-editable text can lead to some weird situation. So better to use a Text component for that."

    "text": "This post is the next installment of my time spent in Hong Kong. The first installment, Bird set free, talked about how I did my 21 days of quarantine and the subsequent 30 days of freedom. In this post, I’ll go over the period of April to July 2021.\nWarning: there will be many pictures involved, and to get most out of the art at the end I’d say, take some time to stand still and record your thoughts.\n\nTurning 30\nThere’s no way around it; this year I got my ticket to get on tram 3, the way we colloquially talk about reaching this milestone. I know that so many people did not get to spend their birthdays the way they wanted in the past year or so, let alone their 30th. So I’ve been quite fortunate that neither last year nor this year a lockdown was in effect at the moment of reaching that age. Yet, I still had a number of thoughts surrounding that age (huh, but age is just a number?! yeah right…).\nI’m proud of what I’ve been able to accomplish so far in life, given the chances afforded to me. But in Chinese there is this Confucian saying sānshí ér lì 三十而立 “At thirty, I stood firm”, meaning that you’re independent and can take care of yourself and your situation at the age of thirty. And I guess that’s kind of true in my situation, but it just didn’t feel like that.\nOn the contrary, I felt quite uprooted: in a new place, no strong network of friends. One might even say, I felt like I was “only thirty” (sānshí ér yǐ 三十而已), or maybe just felt like a new kid on the block (sānshí ér yǐ 三十兒立). In any case, due to circumstances, I spent the b-day alone and ended up just sitting on the beach (sānshí ér zuò 三十而坐) wallowed in existential despair. Here are two pictures of that beach that night:\n\n\n\n\nI truly longed for the warmth of that campfire and those people that night, but could not bring myself to go over and join their party.\nBut I was more than pleasantly surprised that I actually have more friends than I thought here. Throughout the following two weeks or so, I met up with multiple people, and they really pulled me out of my sullen slump. And I am so grateful for that. In this time of covid, we need live interactions more than ever.\nSo thanks Darryl and family for the birthday cake.\n\n\nAnd thanks Ka, Mona, Kayi and Matthew for the dinner and the never ending supply of mussels.\n\n\nAnd thanks Youngah for the lunch. And thanks Marcelo and Arthur for the dinner. And thanks to all the friends I’ve made or reconnected with in the past few months: Ian, Gabor, Szeto, Jinyoung, Pavel, Hengheng, Jonah, Tomo and so on and so on. You’ve really given me the sense of growing some roots here, helping me ground.\n\n\n\n\nIt has taken me a while but I’m in a better space now, and I am also extremely stoked that CJ is nearing the end of his quarantine. So August is going to be awesome!\n\n\nWalking in the mountains\nOne of the things I have been enjoying since moving to Hong Kong is leisurely strolling around my place and the place I work at. I don’t think I’m a full-on hiker, honestly, I come from Belgium and every slope is like a mountain to me okay. But I do enjoy some nice brisk walks.\nSo here I found myself walking up to Victoria Peak. (I don’t like the work hike in English, because in my mental vision that involves full on hiking gear with ropes and pickaxes and what have you. I don’t think we even have the meaning of ‘leisurely walking amidst the mountains’ in the Dutch equivalent bergbeklimmen ‘mountain-climbing’. Idk. Random thoughts.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe view from the Peak was quite nice and a good reward for the upwards trek.\n\n\nAlong the way I encountered Pinewood battery, the remnants of an air defense (built by the British). At first I was heaving and huffing from the climb, but then I regained my composture and reflected a bit about the moment. Much later I wrote a poem about it (I was a bit bored on the ferry ha).\n\n\n\n\n\nPinewood Battery\nCovered by leaves, I hiked the Peak and reached a verdant clearing, pinetrees all around a central circle — batt’ries that were breached when Eastern foes took flight to higher ground.\nThe remnants ruins of that air defense once used to shoot down planes from azure sky. They witnessed fragrant bloodshed, times were tense, yet tranquil on a tourist trail they lie.\nA ghastly whisper beckoned, contemplate the lives cut off too soon for Empires lost. Who mourns here now the dead, their restless fate, except for hikers; was it worth the cost?\nThis all in mind I ask two aunties dear, please take a picture and make sure it’s clear.\n\nI’ve been also been walking around Lamma. Here are some pics from my walk to the windmill.\n\n\n\n\nOh, and did I tell you about the sunsets. So many beautiful sunsets. It’s truly incredible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it’s not just me who is slightly obsessed with sunsets. Every day I see lots of Hong Kongers take pictures of it, enjoying the daily dying of the light. It’s almost as if if nobody caught it on film, we couldn’t be sure that the next day the sun would make the effert to come back and shine upon us all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe moons I’ve witnessed on Lamma are also nice. It’s almost as if Lamma is a manifestation of Mount Penglai or maybe even Avalon. The latter is more probable, as there are many British elements present there (but no apple trees).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI envision myself writing a poem or two about the place that is Lamma in the future. But here is a poem that I thought of when coming across this renovation site in my village (not written by me but the wonderful Doreen Valiente).\n\n\n\nThe Redevelopment.\nThe old house vanished in a dusty cloud, its secrets scattered to the winds of air. Whether its dwellers humble were or proud, they are forgotten, and its walls stand bare.\nSoon the last fragment’s gone. The raw earth gapes. The loud-voiced, sun-bronzed builders have moved in. Now by their hands arise new-fangled shapes, new bricks, fresh concrete, motors roaring din.\nA new room grows, where once in the same place those others dwelt, who lived and loved and died. Who came there young, grew old, perhaps found grace with new hope now who comes here to reside?\nSo turns the wheel of time; the cycle runs for houses, years and galaxies of suns.\n\nThis poem came to me the instant I saw that ruin. I linked it to my own uprooted state that had slowly been trying to undo that uprootedness. And I feel like I succeeded through a budding network of friends and colleagues, but also by becoming more independent. In a way I was able to undergo some internal redevelopment. What helped me was seeking out the beauty expressed by other people. In other words, I went to artsy places, trying to “art” myself – this is play on words, to ground oneself in Dutch is aarden. Naturally, grounding onself through art is then to art oneself.\n\n\nArting myself\nI kept bumping into artsy spaces, so I took it as some kind of sign that I should do more of that. For instance, I decided on a whim to go to Tai Kwun, and they had this really cool exhibition about the moon (also a Taschen bookstore, so nice books).\n\n\n\n\nThen I also happened to get free tickets to Art Central. Here are some really nice paintings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there were also some triptychs with contemporary elements, painted by Japanese artists, which were very interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen some manga/anime art:\n\n\nAnd some funny things:\n\n\n\n\nSome cool things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven the performance art was interesting.\n\n\nAnd here I am with some art by Lousy Lousy.\n\n\nThe only thing I did not like at all was this artwork by an artist who took pie charts to a whole new level. Like, him choosing that to be interesting shows that he hasn’t read up on how bad it is to use pie charts to compare groups. Do not do it people.\n\n\nA while later, for French may, which weirdly comprises May and June, I went to the Hong Kong Museum of Art, which was hosting an exhibition Mythologies: Surrealism and Beyond. Here are pictures of famous works:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there were also some other really nice exhibitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, in the category Arting myself, I rediscovered some art made in highschool:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime to sail away\nSo there you have it. I’m doing well, and increasingly so. The communities I’m lucky to be(come) a part of are becoming more solidified, both professionally and personally – although this update has decidedly focused more on the personal part.\nNow it’s time to take my junk and sail away into the sunset. Cheers."

    "text": "In the previous post I went over my first few months of settling in Hong Kong. Today it’s time to talk about my first visitor and the amazing 43 days of summer we spent. Of course I’m talking about CJ!\nJust like all people entering Hong Kong, except for Nicole Kidman, CJ had to do quarantine. The hotel was the same as the one I had stayed in during my voluntary confinement, so it was quite decent. But going over there to drop off some survival packages for him provided me with a complementary perspective: I got to see the hotel from the outside, knowing full well what went down behind that barrier that I couldn’t pass. It was weird to be so close yet so far, after almost a year.\nOn 1 August CJ got out of his 14-day quarantine, so I took a ferry to fetch him. Seeing him emerge from the check-out counter was really joyous for both of us: oof, we had made it. As his first post-quarantine meal he had decided on Shake Shack hamburgers (I had done so too), so we went to the IFC, one of the Two Towers of Hong Kong and feasted on food and views — Shake Shack is located on the rooftop of the IFC.\nNext came the perilous journey to Lamma. As soon as we set sail (okay, okay, we didn’t do that much sailsetting but rather sat inside in the AC-controlled room, enjoying the polar temperatures that are so common for Hong Kong), it started POURING. In fact, it was raining so badly that we could see cats and dogs falling out of the sky, just short of a sharknado. As we got to Lamma, the weather app informed us that, indeed, locally on Lamma there was an extreme amount of raindrops that kept falling on our heads. Don’t believe, here’s a pic because it did happen. And this was when it had already subsided a bit. Eventually we made it up the mountain and we could just be at ease.\nOver the next few days we slowly slid into a daily rhythm. I had to work and so did CJ so we did spend a lot of time together in my of office. While those daily moments were fun, that is probably not why you’re here, dear reader, so I won’t dilly-dally nor beat around any bushes, but just take you on a tour of the highlights."

We took pictures with the free-roaming cows and statues of the 12 arhats, and still climbed up to his bodhiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was also the Po Lin monastery which was pretty beautiful (and I have seen many Chinese temples so I have a frame of reference). Adding to the athmosphere was the praying of the monks that could be heard from outside of their hall which we weren’t allowed to enter."

But now there’s a tutorial on how to do simple anova within a tidymodels framework for deciding if you should keep an interaction or not."

    "text": "Christmas and New Year\nFor Christmas and New Year I hosted friends at my place. The deal was simple: I would make dessert and they would cook all the rest. And an even better part of the deal was that we had different cuisines from across Asia: China, Korea and Japan (in no particular order I love you all equally).\n\n\nFor New Year my Japanese friend Tomo came over again and this time I was treated to a full-blown Japanese dinner. This was after we had eaten pizza so of course we couldn’t finish it. But on the upside, we had food for a few days after the event.\n\n\nBut it wasn’t the only Christmas party I went to. In fact, I had a wonderful Christmas Eve: I was on a boat, with the CJ highschool crew. I had a good time.\n\n\nAnd I also went over to my supervisor Youngah’s place. Jinyoung had told me to memorize the phrase chodaehae jusyeoseo gamsahabnidaang 초대해 주셔서 감사합니다앙, which means “thanks for inviting me”. Luckily it maps well on the meter of Jingle Bells so I was able to do so. The food was also really good.\n\n\nAnd speaking of good food: also with other friends from school we had some really nice dinners. I didn’t take a picture of the food at Christmas but at Thanksgiving – which was the first time I celebrated that, like ever – we had a big turkey. With the magic of perspective it looks even bigger.\n\n\nAnd at the end of 2021 I also found myself part of a pubquiz team, which has been pretty fun as well. Our team name is “I thought it was a disco”, which is a welcome change from the typical “Jezus Kwistus” I get back in Belgium. Here’s a picture of us being victorious."

Given the current stringent covid measures in Hong Kong I don’t know when I will see them again.\n\n\nI also said goodbye to one of my office mates, Jackie, who has been very fun to work across from. Luckily we still have Gabe and Anna to talk to. Well, after this covid wave ends. Here is a picture of the four musketeers on Lamma. Good memories and better times.\n\n\nFor Chinese New Year, finally, I also had the same nationalities over. Ying Heng, Jinyoung, and Tomo made delicious food.

    "text": "I don’t often see poetry books that immediately make me go OMG must have but this interview with poet Fāng Shāngyáng 方商羊 piqued my interest, especially when I saw he had written a poem called 轰隆隆 is the sound of thunder.\n\nFang Shangyang\nFang’s debut collection Burying the mountain is available since the end of October of 2021, and a copy of it currently finds itself in my shopping cart, patiently awaiting the moment I decide to pull the trigger and press the button which will send it on its way to me. So far, I haven’t but the day is definitely drawing closer.\nIn any case, you can find more about the poet from his twitter or the collection from the publisher. Currently, that page features him reading some of his work in a video, which I will embed here first.\n\n\nWhile there is something in the way he’s reading poetry that I find slightly off-putting, I can’t help but respect how he appears to be visibly captivated by his own writing. Admirable.\n\n\nThunder only happens when it’s raining\nHowever, Fang is maybe not why you’re here! You’re perhaps wondering why I am writing about him and his work on this blog. When I saw in the aforementioned interview that he had written a poem entitled 轰隆隆 is the sound of thunder, I knew I had to see what that was all about. After all, I have a greater-than-average interest in Chinese onomatopoeias and ideophones. And I also happen to have written about iconicity in meteorological expressions before!\nIn my paper “Does the thunder roll? Mandarin Chinese meteorological expressions and their iconicity” (Van Hoey 2018, doi: 10.1163/23526416-00402003) (Contact me if you want to read a copy but you don’t have access), I talk about the two kinds of motivation that we can observe in weather-related ideophones.\nA first kind, let’s call them colloquial ideophones, are formally marked in their phonology, mostly through different types of reduplication (full and partial). The way iconicity or sound symbolism works in these words is that when you try to map aspects of the sound on the meaning of the expressions and notice a resemblance. For instance, the back vowels and nasals /oŋ/ in hōnglónglóng perhaps evoke the rumbling (notice the back vowel and nasal in rumbling) of thunder. Or in ablaut ideophones like xīlī huālā or dīdī dādā you get that alternating “over here (high vowel /i,i/) … over there (low vowel /a,a/)” effect. Combined with the fricatives of /x/ and /h/, it’s easy to imagine a kind of sluicing rainfall in xīlī huālā. And then l- reduplication is well-known in Chinese as a marker of continuation. Compare this to the unaspirated alveolar /d/’s of dīdī dādā that indicate drips and drops.\nJust so we’re clear, I’m not saying these words are compositional in the way Hamano has argued for Japanese, but conversely that I can see how structural mappings can be identified or imagined.\n\nhōnglónglóng (轟)隆 隆 ‘sound of thunder’\nxīlī huālā 唏 哩 嘩 啦 ‘streaming and sluicing, heavy rainfall’\ndīdī dādā 滴 滴 答 答 ‘lighter rainfall, just beginning or about to end’\n\nThe second kind, literary ideophones by lack of a better term also typically display formal phonological markedness (full or partial reduplication) and also sometimes some phonesthemic-like elements. However, what sets them apart is that they can rely more on radical support. Radical support is the idea that the graphical form of a (Chinese) word contains a semantic element that is expressed, often repeated, that indicates something about the meaning of that word. Most people know that onomatopoeia (sound ideophones) in Mandarin often have a 口 MOUTH element, e.g., jījī zhāzhā 嘰嘰喳喳 ‘sound of birds chirping; sound of people chattering’. But literary ideophones typically have other radicals. In the examples below WATER 氵 and RAIN ⻗. They are also typically older and not as in use in spoken language as the colloquial ones; but of course, they often turn up in song lyrics, sung in karaoke bars. So I wouldn’t flat out say they don’t belong to the contemporary Chinese, just that there is a genre effect.\n\nlínlín 淋淋 ‘streaming and sluicing; dash and splatter’\nlínlí 淋漓 ‘light drizzle’\nmàimù 霢霂 ‘soaked and steeped’\nfēifēi 霏霏 ‘heavy snowfall or rainfall’\npīlì 霹靂 ‘thunderclap, thunderbolt’\n\n\n\nHōnglónglóng is the sound of thunder\nAnyways, I can go on and on about these words but it’s now time to turn back to Fang Shangyang and his 轰隆隆 is the sound of thunder. I will present the poem below, which, in the spirit of fair use and commentary on (please Shangyang Fang or publishing house, I do this out of love and don’t come back to sue me, I hope you sell many copies), I have augmented with pinyin in red so as to show how to pronounce these words and so that you can enjoy the poem to its fullest.\nAlso, pay attention to what kind of ideophones are used here. They virtually all belong to the colloquial stratum, which tells you that indeed, we should be reading the poem out loud to make most sense of it.\nFinally, I hope the lay-out matches that of the original poem but I can’t be sure. Just know that it’s supposed to have a few lines per paragraph usually.\nOkay, enjoy!\n轰隆隆 hōnglōnglōng Is the Sound of Thunder \nBy Shāngyáng Fāng 方商羊\nis the rain stitching a bell jar, or the clock remembering its days\nas a clepsydra.扑通 pūtōng is the sound of: man stumbling\n＆ 哈哈哈哈 hāhāhāhā is the laughter that chases after\n玲玲琅琅 línglíng lángláng is the water sword whacking the 哐当锵锵 kuāngdāng qiāng qiāng jade pendants\nof cold rocks. 飒飒瑟瑟 sàsà sèsè is the west wind & 扑扑簌簌 pūpū sùsù\nis the falling leaves that 萧萧翩翩 xiāoxiāo piānpiān with an autumnmoon\nIn fact, 簌簌 sùsù is the sound of all soft things falling\nThe tears 簌簌 sùsù on the face.

    "text": "One of the best things of my postdoc at HKU has been the collaboration with Youngah Do and Arthur Lewis Thompson. At the end of 2021 our first paper was published: “Articulatory features of phonemes pattern to iconic meanings: Evidence from cross-linguistic ideophones”.\nI will give the abstract first, and then give you a few different options to engage with it. Think of it as your own RPG game!\n\nAbstract\n\nIconic words are supposed to exhibit imitative relationships between their linguistic forms and their referents. Many studies have worked to pinpoint sound-to-meaning correspondences for ideophones from different languages. The correspondence patterns show similarities across languages, but what makes such language-specific correspondences universal, as iconicity claims to be, remains unclear. This could be due to a lack of consensus on how to describe and test the perceptuo-motor affordances that make an iconic word feel imitative to speakers.\nWe created and analysed a database of 1,860 ideophones across 13 languages, and found that seven articulatory features, physiologically accessible to all spoken language users, pattern according to semantic features of ideophones. Our findings pave the way for future research to utilize articulatory properties as a means to test and explain how iconicity is encoded in spoken language. The perspective taken here fits in with ongoing research of embodiment, motivation, and iconicity research, three major strands of research within Cognitive Linguistics. The results support that there is a degree of unity between the concepts of imitative communication and the spoken forms through cross-domain mappings, which involve physical articulatory movement.\n\n\n\nI want to read the paper:\nBecause it was the Editor’s choice for the issue of Cognitive Linguistics it was published in, the paper has been made open access, free of charge for us and of course, free of charge for readers.\nClick here to read the paper.\n\n\nI want to watch a video instead:\nFor the 10th installment of the monthly iconicity seminar, creatively entitled IcoSem (hosted by Ian Joo) I presented the main points of our paper. Watch the video here.\n\n\nThanks everybody who was at the talk and especially for everyone that engaged in the Q&A session!\n\n\nI want to look at the data:\nSure enough, here’s the OSF directory with the data.\n\n\nI just want to cite you guys:\nWe’ve got you covered for that as well:\nThompson, Arthur Lewis, Thomas Van Hoey & Youngah Do. 2021.

    "text": "I’m writing this blog post from the comfort of my place back in Belgium, nice and cozy inside while the winter weather is whipping up its winds (no snow) outside. How did we get here? And what am I doing here? Let’s find out in today’s long-overdue update.\nAn instagram poll showed me that my audience there (n = 37) would be most interested in the journey that 2022 was and the friends we made along the way, hence the title of this update. I’d say it’s best we start this blog best somewhere mid February 2022, as the previous blog dealt with the period before. I guess that puts us nicely in sync with the Chinese new year as the starting point for this blog. So, in order to make this extra Chinesey – not to be confused with Chineasy, a book with a catchy title that claims it is easy to learn Chinese but tricks the reader, I cannot stress this enough, do not buy – let’s try to consolidate updates in this blog based on key moments that happened in time frames dictated by the 24 solar terms.\n\nSpring commences 立春 4 Feb\nI guess I’ve always been into cyclical systems like calendars. For instance, learning about how the traditional Chinese calendar worked in my second year of college was super fascinating. Actually, I should be calling them calendars, since it’s both a solar and a lunar calendar that at times needed to be put in sync again. Anyways, here is a picture of me looking at the so-called Wheel of the Year, which contains a cycle of eight seasonal festivals. I like the concept very much, but I didn’t feel like it was particularly applicable to a Hong Kongtext, where it is cold for like 3 weeks in February and December.\n\n\nHere’s a picture of a beautiful tree on the HKU campus. I guess I’m a tree guy.\n\n\n\n\nRain water 雨水 19 Feb\nWhile it wasn’t really cold, being covered by a blanket gives a sense of comfort and coziness that is second nature to Belgians. And apparently also to Polish and Siberian people, as evidenced by this picture of me, Rita and Dasha.\n\n\nThis was the period in which omicron finally made its way into Hong Kong, and all the barbershops closed. Luckily, we had an outside barber on Lamma.\n\n\nBeautiful island with its beautiful sunsets and sunset views. I miss it already. But I am not quite sure if I miss the island or the people and their vibe. Possibly both.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsects awaken 驚蟄 6 Mar\nThe insects awaken and with them the blue skies returned.\n\n\nBut, like, not every day. Sometimes it was still foggy. And on such a day I decided to surprise my friends Tomo and Jinyoung by awaiting them on the Peak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring equinox 春分 21 Mar\n\n\nNight and day are equally long and friends that had been held up (holed up?) abroad started making their way back to Hong Kong. Like Marcelo, who wanted to have a big bite at Big Bite.\n\n\nI also found this replica of Taiwan’s bent post office boxes.\n\n\n\n\nBright and clear 清明 (aka my birthday) 5 Apr\nWhile my 30th birthday was an absolute disaster, at least initially, “due to circumstances”, my 31st was exactly what I wanted. My friends that came over (shoutout to Tomo, Jinyoung, Marcelo and Yingheng) really managed to surprise me and the atmosphere of the evening was just right. Forever grateful.\n\n\nThe highlight of the evening was this beautiful smörgåsbord of Cheesecake Factory cakes.\n\n\nExcitingly, I landed an interview for a faculty position at another university in Hong Kong. Disappointingly, the interviewers were late for the interview, which led me to panic, in an icecold manner, whether or not I was in the correct zoom room for about 4 minutes. Unmannerly, I did not receive any replies on whether I was still in the long/short list after inquiring after a month had passed. I mean, do I really want to work for a department that does not respect potential colleagues? Here is a picture of me with the mixed feelings after the interview. It went well, but they were late… 0/10 would not recommend.\n\n\n\n\nCorn rain 穀雨 20 Apr\nSome of the friends made along the way are actually routes, if that makes sense. There is a sense of comfort in walking along pathways you know well and know better with every iteration. For me that would be the many walks I took along Victoria Harbour (HK side), from HKU to the pier. It didn’t hurt that the weather was amazing and the views appetizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer commences 立夏 6 May\n\n\nMay came around and that means two things: 1) Birthday of CJ, which I couldn’t celebrate with him :( . 2) Eurovision, which I managed to watch all night long with Rita. Great edition, at least for the two of us.\n\n\nMy supervisor Youngah came back to Hong Kong and I had actually missed her while she was gone for about two months, even though we saw each other regularly on zoom.\n\n\nI was also saying goodbye to some friends in preparation for my summer trip: I would be presenting a paper at the Iconicity in Language and Literature conference in Paris at the end of May. Like this fun group of HKU.\n\n\nOr my dear friend Dasha. See you in Europe soon!!\n\n\n\n\nCorn forms 小滿 21 May\nWow I’m back home! And I’m super in love with the way home looks at the cusp of summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also went to Paris! Let’s face it, there are too many pictures from that trip, I am only including the ones with friends here (blame the IG poll).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd also some of the obligatory sightseeing. By the way, I started watching Emily in Paris while it was Thomas in Paris and it’s both cringey and fun. Also, I look like this self-portrait by Van Gogh, but I am Van Hoey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorn on ear 芒種 6 Jun\nBack home and even more in love with the fields that surround my home. And taking long walks with the dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime to meet some friends: ultra fans of this blog and friends since highschool: Ruben and Cedric\n\n\nFriends from sinology days: Lai Man, Silke, Joke, Yoana, Anneleen and me\n\n\nFriends from my student organization: Ann-Sofie and Elisabeth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer solstice 夏至 21 Jun\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case it wasn’t clear, the weather was very good. 10/10.\nIn this period, I went to two very important places. The first is Leuven, where I finally went to visit my friends from the East Asian Library again (Arjan and Benedicte).\n\n\nAnd I also met up with fellow R aficionada and Cognitive linguist Mariana. This turned out to be a very amusing afternoon, and also a very fruitful one, as it led me to my new job, which I will start very soon.\n\n\nThe second trip was visiting Nijmegen (Netherlands), where I spent the afternoon and them some with my other supervisor Mark. Very enjoyable as well and beautiful campus.\n\n\nAs it turns out, one of my friends from my NTU days is now studying in Nijmegen, so I also met up with Yeh Chih, which was the perfect end to a perfect day.\n\n\nAnd I also went to Lier with my dad\n\n\nAnd met with my friends Margaux, Ruben and Kristof\n\n\nAnd almost went to Bonnie’s wedding (sorry I couldn’t make it but happy we saw each other in Brussels!!!)\n\n\n\n\nModerate heat 小暑 7 Jul\nEven thought his solar term is called moderate heat I didn’t think it was very moderate; it was quite hot. And it only got hotter when my Spanish friend Antonio came to visit me. It had been a few years since we had seen each other but some friendships can definitely overcome this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then, one early morning – mind you I was still working during this time and often had meetings starting at 7 AM with a team that was working in HK time – I woke up and my mom told me she had phone problems. Grumbling and not yet quite awake I went to have a look and she showed me a screen of an airplane route, casually saying: “So, we need to pick CJ up this afternoon.” Thinking I was still dreaming, I splashed some water on my face and reconfirmed.\nYou see, a devious and cunning scheme had been going on behind my back, and nobody had told me that this was happening. So there I was, later that day, picking up my dearest baetje at the train station. It felt really good to see him again after 11 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor heat 大暑 23 Jul\nSo this summer back home turned out quite great I would say. We went to Brussels for a walk in the Sonian Forest and what I was selling to my friends as “the Stonehedge of Belgium” but is actually a monument to forestry that’s only about a century old (sorry not sorry).\n\n\n\n\nWe met up with family at a summer.\n\n\nWe met donkeys under an amazing sky.\n\n\n\n\nAnd CJ’s brother TJ also popped in for a visit.\n\n\nAnd, we crossed something of my bucket list, the Vlooyberg tower after visiting my aunt Jenny!\n\n\n\n\nAutumn commences 立秋 8 Aug\nSo it turns out CJ absolutely destroyed me at mini golf. At least the food with the sino friends was good and comforting.\n\n\n\n\nI developed a curious interest in labyrinths. Here’s one in Mechelen.\n\n\nHere’s us celebrating our favourite K-pop band VIXX. #Starlight forever, but also room for new (more active) bands.\n\n\nHere is one of their best songs.\n\n\nAll good songs must come to an end. On CJ’s last day here we went to Leiden. One place we stopped at was the Tolkien store (nerd alert), where I was attacked by an Uruk-Hai.\n\n\nAnd then, a goodbye kiss at the windmill. Luckily, this time, it didn’t take a year before we met up again.\n\n\nOn one of my last days back home I got to meet up with Ann from Taiwann.\n\n\n\n\nThen, a rainbow as I was leaving.\n\n\nAnd an originally 7 days of quarantine that was shortened to 3 days right before I got back. Here’s the HK skyline. By the way, New York does not deserve the epithet concrete jungle as much as Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of heat 處暑 23 Aug\nThe end of heat is only apt for Belgium I suppose, in any case not for Hong Kong. Luckily, Jinyoung was staying at my place during the first few days so I didn’t feel too alone.\n\n\nWe also got new members in the Language Development Lab.\n\n\nAnd I got to embrace Changhe (I forced him into my pun).\n\n\nAnd I got to – finally – participate in a psycholinguistic experiment. The cap is not comfortable.\n\n\nOne of the things that brought me great joy in the last few months was the participation in pub quizzes with Marcelo and friends. Even though we never won, I had great fun.\n\n\n\n\nWhite dew 白露 8 Sep\nSpontaneous encounters are the best. Here’s one with the Polish girls Anna and Rita. Thanks for being so fabulous, even on the 8 AM ferry.\n\n\nIt was at this point that work became really busy as well. And that lasted all the way until the end. # No rest for the wicked (this was the alternative title I had in mind for this update).\n\n\nAutumn equinox 秋分 23 Sep\nLuckily, the more work found itself to me, the more I was able to balance it with outings with friends. And, oooff, I really needed that counter balance. A collection of moments.\nDrinking cuba libre with Rita because of Cuba’s progressiveness.\n\n\nMo also stopped by.\n\n\nAaron’s first shake shack.\n\n\nSaizeriya with Xiaoyu and Bingzi.\n\n\nFrites with Jinyoung and Tomo.\n\n\nSomehow ending up at the Hermès show with Xiaoyu.\n\n\nMy hair stylist Anson Law (like the mirror guy) I’m really gonna miss &lt;3\n\n\nOh, and I beheld a beautiful broken branch. So I’m sharing it with you here.\n\n\nThe sun must be greeted too.\n\n\n\n\nCold dew 寒露 8 Oct\nThis solar term’s title is not applicable to Hong Kong, error 404. This can be evidenced by the warm October nights we spent at the power station beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso one inside picture with Mona, Ka, Kayi and Mattew\n\n\n\n\nFrost 霜降 23 Oct\nIn writing this blog, I have come to realize that the solar terms’ titles reflect my mood rather the Hong Kongnese environment. It started to dawn on me that time spent in the Fragrant Harbour was stretching thin. One thing I got to cross of the bucket list was Cantonese opera (I think it might have been Teochew opera but I’m not sure). Marcelo and Ksenia took me to Farewell my concubine.\n\n\nThe next natsukashii thing is of course Halloween (samhain), one of the highlights of Lamma life. It started with an eerily purple hued sky, and lasted a good amount of time, which I spent watching people with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZack Sparrow.\n\n\nThis beautiful Green Fairy is my Canadian friend Zoë.\n\n\nEwen &lt;3\n\n\nI got to wear this sick helmet.\n\n\nJon the axe killer (pen killer)? There was also a girl with pompoms and a shirt that said “Go ceiling” – she was a ceiling fan.\n\n\nMi amigo Carlos Cuarto.\n\n\n\n\nBeginning of winter 立冬 7 Nov\nI MET AN INFLUENCER – rope skipping legend Pakhung Jai.\n\n\nAnd I was visited by more and more people from HKU: Aaron, Samuel and Wayne. Fond memories were created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and maybe you don’t know this about me (hi nice to meet you) but quite often girls will fall asleep on my shoulders. Proof.\n\n\n\n\nThis has been a lot\nTo end with a sort of cliffhanger, I think I will end here, and talk about the transitory period of my leaving Hong Kong, going to Taiwan, arriving in Belgium and beginning my new job for the next update (early February?). That way, we can do the last five solar terms and be done with it.\nAs always, thanks for reading, and thanks for enriching my life this year, whether we met IRL or just interacted online. 2022 was a pretty great year, despite having to deal with some major unpleasant moments that can only be epitomized by #Free Britney Spears’s hit single Toxic. Luckily, I got to lean on a select bunch of you to get through it and I’m very grateful for that.\nLet me know if you are interested in reading particular things on this blog.\n’ello ’ello hola bonjour and ciao!"

    "text": "Leaving the liminal, a play on a book I recently read, is an excellent title for this blog post, in which I will cover the final months in Hong Kong and the first months back in Belgium. As I hinted at last time, my return to Hong Kong in September (2022) was marked by the temporality of it all. And it wasn’t the first time I was in this temporary zone – it had happened in autumn 2020 as well, as I was preparing for going to Hong Kong. This particular temporary transitional phase resembles the state of being on a threshold: not quite outside anymore but not yet inside either. In other words, a liminal phase.\nAnd I entered just such a phase in the month leading up to my departure from the big kong. So let’s begin from where we left off last time, and enter the liminal.\n\n\n\nGoodbye gatherings\nOne of the most salient hallmarks of my imminent departure were all the gatherings with friends and colleagues. I have enjoyed all of them, whether it was pizza party, home dinner, walk around the block or gathering on or under a roof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso the idea of liminality was felt most clearly at the following exact time: 7 December 2022 at around 21 o’clock. At this particular time I met up with my friend Rita on the beach – itself not quite land and not quite sea, between the wild nature of Lamma Island and the steampunk inducing Power Station, under the full moon. I had already officially left HKU, but not quite yet Hong Kong. But at the same time the liminal is a time and space where some of the most transformational things can happen, like me reflecting on and reappreciating the times past and the times ahead. Oh and we made a bonfire, which is always super fun.\nI cannot stress enough how thankful I am that I met these people. Even though I left, I feel good knowing that I’ve taken a piece of them with me, in return for offering up a piece of myself to them. Thanks for being guiding stars in my life.\n\n\n\n\nThe final week\nApart from the stress induced by dealing with all the administration (in a broad term, including taxes, rental contracts, clearing out my apartment, avoiding mr Toxic), I kept thinking of what I wanted to do these final week. Other people might want to go hiking or whatever, but I just mostly wanted to revisit places I had enjoyed before. And that includes museums. Here are some pictures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last day\nI went to Madame Tussaud’s, where I was alone. So of course I perfected my selfie skills and took *many* selfies memories I will treasure forever.\nThat time I got crowned to Miss Universe\n\n\nThat time I got kidnapped by the Hulk\n\n\nThat time I got to sing on stage with JJ Lin\n\n\nThat time Gaga wanted to take a pic with me\n\n\nThat time GEM and I were recording our new hit song\n\n\nThat time Jay Chou requested to work with me\n\n\nThat time Super Junior Siwon and I were on the red carpet\n\n\nThat time I got into a fight with Bruce Lee. Be like water my friends.\n\n\nThat time Marilyn and I stood on top of a vent\n\n\nThat time I visited Yayoi Kusuma in her natural habitat\n\n\nThat time I taught the Queen (RIP) how to take a selfie\n\n\nThat time I was sparkling in the sun with ~Edward Culllen~ Robert Pattinson\n\n\nThat time I got breakfast at Tiffany’s\n\n\nThen I said goodbye to HKU\n\n\n\n\nAnd then I left…\n\n\n\n\nTo Taiwan\nThat’s right, I left Hong Kong to go to Taiwan for a week, to meet up with CJ, aka Baetje.\n\n\nWe also went to a museum lol, where they had an exhibition about the crazy 80s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also met up with some of my Tatung University students.\n\n\n\n\nAnd I got to revisit NTU and meet up with some of my NTU peeps!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we did karaoke (which I had done before leaving HK as well)\n\n\nAlas, all good things come to an end. Time to say goodbye to CJ and head home. Still in the liminal zone. At least I got *a whole row* on the plane for myself.\nGoodbye CJ &lt;3\n\n\n\n\nRenaissance picture with my dad and my luggage\n\n\nWhoopi longlingly awaiting my arrival\n\n\nA citizen of Wuustwezel (Loenhoutttttt) once more. I’m sorry but we have the most beautiful town hall.\n\n\nOh yeah it became 2023 and I started work at KU Leuven, with Benedikt Szmrecsanyi (more on that in another update). Here is me on my first day, going from Leuven’s city hall to the Erasmushuis, which is where the Faculty of Arts is housed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n魯汶風雅，於斯爲盛。 “Literary pursuits at Leuven, may I flourish here.”\n\nThis calligraphy hangs right across from my office; it’s as if they knew I was coming here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Oxford\nStarting the new project in Leuven required that I pay a visit to Matt Gardner in Oxford. So I did, and in passing visited some scenic views of Oxford, as well as the musical Wicked. A trip to Oxford, in this day and age, also requires compatible reading. I chose Babel, Or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators’ Revolution by RF Kuang. It was a great book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, I saw a student use ChatGPT for writing a paper while on the train.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy road of good intentions led where such roads always lead, i.e., the musical Wicked.\n\n\n\n\nCan we also talk about the bookstores of London, urgh.\n\n\nIncluding the Atlantis bookshop &lt;3\n\n\nAnd Treadwells, where I trod well.\n\n\nFinally, I also met up with Franzi and Antonio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving liminality\nImbolc came and February passed by as well.\n\n\nI went for a fancy birthday dinner for my mom and we took my aunt as well. Looking good ladies!\n\n\nAnd I was invited for another birthday dinner (Chiara, in yellow).\n\n\nI can say that the feeling is much different from when I got to Hong Kong. If you recall (or if you want to reread), I felt quite uprooted in Hong Kong. While I eventually grew some roots there, the feeling here has been much different. I can’t figure out if it’s the familiarity of coming back home, back to an alma mater, back to a number of friends (although meeting up with some of them turns out to be more arduous than it should be :s :s ), or feeling relieved about the absence of a certain coworker. In any case, I’m back, transformed after 7 years abroad and ready to face the future.\nLeaving liminality, but, you know what, I’m Leuven it."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Shamelessly plugging my new article in Cognitive Linguistics, entitled “ABB, a salient prototype of collocate–ideophone constructions in Mandarin Chinese.” click me\n\n\nABB, not ABBA\nImagine.\nThe year is 2019. It’s September. You’re eating Chicago deep dish “pizza” in Taipei. Suddenly you hear people nearby play a fun game where they have to take turns saying a words of a certain form. If they’re too slow or say a wrong one, they’re out.\nThis actually happened to, and I couldn’t believe my ears. The words in question all had the syllabic template of ABB.\n\nlǜ-yóuyóu\nyìng-bāngbāng\nhēi-xūxū\n\nThese, respectively, mean “very verdant green”, “super hard” and “deep black”. And as most speakers of Chinese languages will know, the BB part of them will add a certain vivid quality to the A part. The greenness of lǜ 綠 is elaborated in a vivid manner by the slipperiness of yóuyóu, which helps because yóuyóu 油油 means ‘oil oil’. On the other hand, the hardness of yìng 硬 ‘hard’ is elaborated by the hardness depicted by bāngbāng 邦邦. And the blackness of hēi 黑 by the BB part xūxū 魆魆.\nThese are one of the most fun parts of learning Chinese (honestly, all kinds of vivid words are fun to a certain degree, see Dingemanse & Thompson 2020) and absolutely necessary to become a fluent speaker of Mandarin, but also Cantonese or other varieties, and they have special predictive properties as well (see Thompson et al. 2022).\n\n\nABB, sound symbolism and ideophones\nAlready in the 1970s we find scholars like Benjamin K. T’sou (1978) stating that ABB forms are a particular locus for identifying sound symbolism in Chinese. Even if you don’t know what sound symbolism is, you may have hear about words like kiki and bouba. If I told you that one of these words sounds round and curvy, while the other is spiky and angular, there’s a very high chance that you would say kiki is the spiky angular one. There’s a whole field of linguistics that tries to identify patterns where the formal aspect of language (sound, but also writing) in some way reveal something about the meaning. That field is called iconicity.\nNow, strictly speaking, not all statistical formal patterns that tell us something about the meaning are iconic, but that’s not the topic of this post. This post is also not about identifying particular mappings in ABB words.\nWhat this post is about, is how ABB words - after that great observation by T’sou - were basically only studied from formal aspects and how they hang together with other permutations of patterns in which occur, think juggling letters like ABAB, ABB, BBA etc.\nThat led me to the belief (in my dissertation, Van Hoey 2020) that we should really be looking at these words from a more function point-of-view. If ABB words are so vivid, then that must mean there is at least the possibility that there is ideophony at play in them.\nIdeophones can be cross-linguistically defined as “marked words that depict sensory imagery and which belong to an open lexical class” (Dingemanse 2019). But you probably know them as onomatopoeias. The only meaningful difference (for the majority of people in the field) is that onomatopoeia is seen as depiction of sound, while ideophones are much broader, covering senses like visual patterns, inner feelings, textures etc., which are not really in the scope of the term onomatopoeia.\n\n\nWhere am I going with this\nOkay, so if ABB words potentially involve ideophone-like qualities, then most likely it will be in the BB part, as reduplication is a highly frequent trait of ideophones across languages. The A part, then, is somewhat of a fixed collocate of this ideophone. How do I know it’s fixed? Well, if you can play a game that’s not just random syllables of the form ABB, then there is a certain degree of idiomaticity at play as well.\nSo it stands to reason to think of ABB words as collocate-ideophone constructions.\nBut ABB words are not the only party in town (a reviewer in my article that I’m gonna plug in a second did not like that phrasing so I’m recycling it here). There are many other collocates we can look at, in varying length.\nIn my article that recently came out in Cognitive Linguistics (currently ahead of print) I basically regale the story of ABB words, how they were studied traditionally, and what it would mean to treat them as collocate-ideophone constructions.\nOf course, if they are collocate-ideophone constructions, they are probably “special” among those constructions, and I do find that they are prototypical in a sense. So finally I look at all the data from a number of perspectives, such as type frequency, token frequency, cue validity, dispersion. Finally, I put these single sources of information together in “tuples”.\nAnyways, I hope you’ll check out the article.\nVan Hoey, Thomas. 2023. ABB, a salient prototype of collocate–ideophone constructions in Mandarin Chinese. Cognitive Linguistics aop. https://doi.org/10.1515/cog-2022-0031.\nAnd if you don’t have access to it, I’m more than happy to share it with you.\n\n\nI don’t wanna read, I just want to hear your voice\nOkay, for these people I also have a solution. I presented this in a talk last summer.\nVan Hoey, Thomas. 2022. ABB, a salient prototype of collocate-ideophone constructions in Mandarin Chinese. In.

    "title": "Iconicity in ideophones: Guessing, memorizing, and reassessing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hooray, our paper came out, openly accessible in Cognitive Science! Its title is “Iconicity in ideophones: Guessing, memorizing, and reassessing” and you can find it here.\nGrateful to have been able to work with my co-authors: Arthur Lewis Thompson, Youngah Do and Mark Dingemanse.\n\nAbstract\n(skip this if it’s too technical)\n\nIconicity, or the resemblance between form and meaning, is often ascribed to a special status and contrasted with default assumptions of arbitrariness in spoken language. But does iconicity in spoken language have a special status when it comes to learnability? A simple way to gauge learnability is to see how well something is retrieved from memory. We can further contrast this with guessability, to see (1) whether the ease of guessing the meanings of ideophones outperforms the rate at which they are remembered; and (2) how willing participants’ are to reassess what they were taught in a prior task—a novel contribution of this study. We replicate prior guessing and memory tasks using ideophones and adjectives from Japanese, Korean, and Igbo. Our results show that although native Cantonese speakers guessed ideophone meanings above chance level, they memorized both ideophones and adjectives with comparable accuracy. However, response time data show that participants took significantly longer to respond correctly to adjective–meaning pairs—indicating a discrepancy in a cognitive effort that favored the recognition of ideophones. In a follow-up reassessment task, participants who were taught foil translations were more likely to choose the true translations for ideophones rather than adjectives. By comparing the findings from our guessing and memory tasks, we conclude that iconicity is more accessible if a task requires participants to actively seek out sound-meaning associations.\n\n\n\nBackground\nAs regular readers of this blog will know, ideophones are iconic words. That means that their meanings are somehow apparent in the sounds of those words. Or, there is a perceived resemblance between form and meaning.\nWe have known for a while now that people all over the world are sensitive so certain form-meaning mappings, especially in laboratory phonology studies, which use stimuli like kiki and bouba (go ask your grandma which one she thinks is ‘round and curvy’ and which one is ‘sharp and spiky’ — I bet she’ll make the correct choice [but also don’t come at me for your earnings]).\nWe have also known that infants and children pick up these words really early. Think of the time you had to learn the sounds of all animals. That’s easy and evocative because those onomatopoeic sounds have a strong resemblance in form and meaning.\nResearchers have proposed that it’s exactly that form-meaning mapping that makes it easier to remember those onomatopoeic sounds. And so they’re easier to learn, because you need to less of an effort to make arbitrary connections, like you have to do for most words, e.g., the word wall doesn’t indicate anything about its meaning of WALL.\nAnd if those words are easier to learn, they should also be easier to memorize right?\n\n\nGuessing\nBut actually, learning is such a big and vague task, that it’s useful to separate how “guessable” these words are by virtue of their form. For instance, you can probably guess that miāo is a sound made by a cat (in Chinese), but can you guess what the word nuru-nuru in Japanese means? If I tell you that it means ‘slippery’ you might make an easy connection there between those /n/ and /r/ sounds, but one that may not be obvious just by looking at it. So that means that miāo is more guessable than nuru-nuru.\nOkay, quick side note, another recent paper by McLean et al. (2023) talks about these issues as well, so go check that out when you’re done here.\nThere are quite a few studies that look the guessability of words, often using English speakers. In our study, we wanted to see if Cantonese speakers were good at guessing the meaning of ideophones. And we used ideophones from three languages (Igbo, Japanese, Korean).\nThis experiment, which replicated the methods of a study by Dingemanse et al. 2016 found that our Cantonese participants are very good at guessing the correct meaning when presented with two choice alternatives. As expected, especially for ideophones depicting sound meanings.\n\n\n\nMemorizing\nOkay, so we were interested in learning. After making sure that our participants were sensititive to these words, we were wondering how good they would be at remembering them.\nSo we conducted another experiment, inspired by Lockwood et al. (2016).\nWe made it quite tricky. Half of the form-meaning mappings that participants learned were correct (nuru-nuru meaning ‘slippery’) and half of them were wrong (nuru-nuru means ‘flashing light’). After being exposed to those words we asked them whether they had learned a particular mapping.\nIt’s kind of like the game of Memory: you get presented with a form and a meaning and you need to tell whether they fit together or not, based on what you learned. It turns out that, on average, it’s hit or miss. There is no particular memory benefit in the ideophones we tested with Cantonese speakers that leads to a good memorisation.\n\nAlso, importantly, we also conducted this experimental protocol with adjectives and the results were very similar. It’s all in the paper, but I’m just highlighting the ideophone part here.\n\n\nReassessing\nRemember how participants sometimes had to learn the correct meaning for an ideophone and other times a wrong, coerced meaning? That comes back now.\nAfter the memorization task, we basically told them: hey, we have taught you the wrong meaning for half of the words you had to learn. Now it’s your turn to think again about these words. And then we exposed them to another guessing task. But because it’s after teaching and after memorizing, it’s in fact a reassessment task.\nThe participants were pretty good at this task (details in paper).\nWhat I’ll show here is whether participants decided to stick with the meaning they had learned or choose the alternative we presented to them. After all, if ideophones have iconic aspects to tap into, people should be reluctant to choose the alternative when given the choice to change what they had learned, and vice versa, should be eager to change when presented with the real meaning, abandoning the wrong meaning because it was not motivated in a form-meaning mapping.\nI quickly mentioned that we also looked at adjectives. For those words, we didn’t have any special predictions, but it turns out they be have somewhat similar to ideophones, although the effect is much less strong when we ran models.\nSo here you can see (on the right side) how the yellow mean is low at the 20% mark. This means that for those items, which were taught in the right condition, participants stuck to the original meaning they had learned. For coerced meanings (right side, blue), we get a mean of 57% or so, indicating very easy choices for the alternatives.\nLooking at adjectives the true form-meaning mapping was also low, but the coerced one much closer to the halfway mark.\n\nFor the other languages we found similar results (in the paper), though maybe less pronounced. The models we ran indicate that there are significant effects of language (Japanese &gt; Korean &gt; Igbo) and of course of type (ideophone &gt; adjective), as well as some important interactions with the condition boosting or curbing the effects.\nBut you’ll have to read the whole paper for that!\n\n\nMain take away\nIdeophones are, once again, proven to be quite guessable. However, the guessability aspects do not necessarily correlate with memory benefits (veridical recall). This may be because not all tasks invite people to think of form-meaning mappings as driven by iconicity. In fact, once given the chance to rethink and reassess the meanings of certain words, participants may tap into iconicity and choose the correct meaning after all, even if they didn’t remember whether they had learned a particular form-meaning pair.\nNot all tasks investigating iconicity are equally good at drawing out iconicity.

    "text": "This post chronicles my time spent in quarantine in Hong Kong back in February and my subsequent release and first month free in March 2021. The title of the post is inspired by Sia’s song Bird set free, although I must admit that I know why the caged bird sings (by Maya Angelou) was a strong contender for a title as well.\n\n\n\nFlying from BE to HK\nAs I detailed in this post, I spent the latter half and the first month of 2021 or so in Belgium, back home, and loved it. But I was also getting excited for moving to Hong Kong for my new job at HKU. This was not an easy getaway. Not only did I have to apply for the work visa and all other necessary documents; but in times of covid I would also need to have tests taken at the right time within the right window to even be allowed to use the plane ticket that I also paid for.\nSo there I was, within my 72 hour window before my flight, lining up outside, between the cars in the drive-through covid test site in Brasschaat. The cold made the depth reached by the unnecessary long stick up my nose hurt even worse and I felt a phantom pain as I was making my way back.\nFast forward two days. Hooray, a negative test, now off to Brussels Airport, where I had to take a fast test to enter the Netherlands, which was unnecessary and stupid, but required. 40 minutes later this also gave me a negative test result and I could finally board the plane from Brussels to Amsterdam. Going up. Going down.\nThen I had to wait for quite a while and finally got ready to board. It didn’t look like it was going to be a full flight, but maybe a lot of people were late? Anyway, we had to show yet once again all the million test results and right documents, so we could board the plane.\nAs it turned out, there were only four passengers, and 10 crew members. Unfortunately, one of the four of us had decided to pay for an upgrade to business class while right before boarding and that meant that he got to enjoy all the perks that came with that, while the remaining three of us had to stay in economy. Later, on of the flight attendants told me that if he hadn’t done that, we would all have been upgraded for free. Yet, all things considered, it was a joyous flight. Here is a picture of me expressing my joy.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we arrived at the airport, it felt like we had just entered a ghost town. A long guided trail led us from station to station. We had to show our test results, show that we had the necessary documents to enter, show that our tests were not just photoshopped, show this, show that …and finally got tested again (within my 72-hour window!!). Then we were sat at tables to await the test results and fitted with fashionable wristbands that we could not take off for the following 21 days of quarantine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaged bird\nAfter being fitted with the trendy covid fitbit, I was taken to the hotel I had booked for 21 consecutive nights. I chose L’Hotel Island South – now rebranded as the Nina Hotel Island South – and honestly, it was a good experience, given the circumstances. People following my instagram (@simazhi y’all) could see daily updates on the food + ratings. Here’s a small selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy room had two beds, but luckily also wifi, a bathtub, tv, a minifridge and a nice city view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yeah, I should probably also mention that by this point it had been 2.5 months since I had had a haircut, due to the restrictions in Belgium and also quarantine. So expect to see some wild hairstyles in this post.\nI was surprised a number of times during my stay at the hotel, two of which had to do with the wonderful care packages from my current boss Dr. Youngah Do. Words cannot express the happiness I felt at receiving this.\n\n\n\n\nEmotionally, though, the lack of real world contact was quite hard. It’s one thing to see other people on a computer screen and interact with them, but I was so happy every time I caught a rare glimpse of a hotel staff member delivering food. And the tests on day 17 and 20 were also kind of enjoyable, since I got to interact with real humans, who talked back to me, in real life and proximity. There was also a fun little gimmick in the hotel: a delivery from a robot.\n\n\nI mean, the robot delivery was a fun activity but real interaction is still best. And it didn’t help that I could see people from my window, all the way down (I was on the 23th floor) in the distance. I tried to still my feelings about this aspect of life that had suddenly been taken away from me by not focusing on the world outside, even though the weather was so good those days. My cage was a physical containment, but the mind can wander and I developed a meditation practice, but also watched like half of Netflix.\n\n\nBird set free\nFinally, the day came that it was my final day. When the clock struck 00:00, I did not lose my glass shoe but instead took off my covid fitbit tracker, deleted the Stay Home Safe app, and felt a huge weight lifte off my back.\n\n\nYet, the next day, as I prepared my luggage for leaving, I felt a bit 捨不得 ‘reluctant to say goodbye’. I once again took pictures of every corner of my room, and to this day still think of the gingo leaf painting that was my only fixed view for 21 days. But then it was time to prepare the bags and take a picture with the hotel once I was out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside, I was being picked up by my friend and colleague Dr. Arthur Thompson, who kindly offered me a place to sleep for the unforeseeable future, while I looked for a place to live. So we went to eat ShakeShack (first post-quarantine food) and then took the ferry to Lamma island, and then took a sunset pic on the beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t worry, it’s not a nuclear power plant.\n\n\nNesting at HKU\nThe day after my release on the 28th of February, we went to the University of Hong Kong, where I got to meet my new boss in real life again. It was very joyful and bound to lead to a good cooperation. Here is a picture of the three of us in our small iconicity and ideophones team. As well as a view from the grad students office on the 9th floor where I would take a seat for a while.\n\n\n\n\nI’m planning to periodically write about the research that we’re doing so stay tuned for that.\n\n\nI got a haircut at some point, which was perfect to take sunset pictures with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigratory bird\nThe homefront has told me they want to see more pictures so in this section I’m just showing a few places I went to visit in these first two months. Perhaps it is also useful to link to my first visit to Hong Kong in 2013. If you can read Dutch then this is really a gem of a blogpost. It also lays the foundation my tourist impression of Hong Kong and explains why I visited Chi Lin Nunnery 志蓮淨苑 and the adjoining Nanlian Garden 南蓮園池 within the first few weeks of being here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my travel companions and myself in 2013, this garden really was stunning and a well-deserved cover of the contemporary Lonely Planet guide. I find that strolling in the garden really enables me to put my mind at ease. So I’ve returned to it with CJ and Arthur in subsequent visits.\nLet me know if you want to see more pictures of this idyllic place on earth. But Hong Kong is not only Chi Lin Nunnery, lol; there’s also lots of temples. For instance, there is the Man Mo Temple 文武廟, dedicated to the god of writing and literacy Man Tai 文帝 and the marial Mo Tai 武帝. Fun fact, tai in Cantonese, or dì in Mandarin means ‘emperor’ as well and there are lots of emperors throughout history who posthumously are referred to as Wéndì 文帝 and Wǔdì 武帝.\nWhen I first visited the Man Mo in 2013 I was a bit disappointed, not a lot was going on and the nice spiral incense cones we were promised in the guidebook weren’t lit at all. Things were different this time around. The day I happened to visit the temple it was super busy, and I also offered some incense to the deer statue. Deer are an interesting animal and I’ve come to appreciate them increasingly in the past few years, for instance on my trip to Japan in 2019 (for which I did not write a blogpost??).\n\n\n\n\nAlso, here I am with the Choi Hung “Rainbow” station!\n\n\n\n\nBird-watching\nI also love going to see some art (mostly painting or sculpture). And discovering that HKU has a university museum with exhibitions was kind of nice. I got to see Ng Lung Wai’s Painting across the threshold, where he uses a folding paint technique. Very cool effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was also an exhibition on Congolese artists, “Colours of Congo: Patterns, Symbols and Narratives in 20th-Century Congolese Paintings”, which was very beautiful and interesting. I learned a lot from the selection of paintings they had, and the pointillism style really appealed to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re in Hong Kong, do go check these exhibtions out!\n\n\nRoosting on Lamma\nIt became clear quite early on that I was interested in settling on Lamma Island. And even though this island has snakes, bugs and wild boar, it’s also quite vibrant and fun to escape the city on a daily basis. I still love the ferry commute, although it’s quite a journey to go to work, but I love the view of seeing Hong Kong in all its vertical concrete glory rise up as I approach it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I hope this was a fun read for you. More adventures in the future and stay tuned for April and May in June! Baibai from the rooftop of the IFC, looking at Kowloon!"

    "text": "I’m writing this post from my compulsory quarantine hotel in Hong Kong, where I started my postdoctoral fellowship this month. However, by being secluded from the outside–I literally cannot open the window and take a breath of fresh air, luckily the air conditioning system is working optimally–has made me realize how much I have missed just being in Belgium at home during my PhD in Taiwan. Here are some moments that have stood out for me.\n\nMeeting friends\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, and Belgium’s less than optimal situation, I only managed to see perhaps a tenth of the people I was looking forward to meet. Luckily, I did get to meet the ones I met, and I want other people to know that I did yearn for meeting up with them, but unfortunately the situation become worse over time, resulting in nasty measures like the closing of restaurants and bars, museums, or almost anything really.\nThe first friend I met up with was Cedric, who took me to the “city” where we went to high school together.\n\n\nThe next time I saw him, he brought my dear old classmate and his dear old twin brother Ruben, who were just stopping by for a socially distanced hi.\n\n\nLater on I would visit Cedric in Brussels, where we went to the museums (after they opened again in January!). It was also an opportunity to use the free train tickets that Belgium government made the national railway company give to each citizen that wanted one. Of course, Belgium’s gonna Belge, and the railway company made it so that you had 12 free trips (hooray!), but divided over six months with two trips per month, basically reducing the value of such a gift to nothing. Still, it took me to Brussels, the capital. This is Cedric and me on the Grand Place, not far from Manneken Pis, which was too small to take a good picture of. Also, please don’t mind the coronacoupe hairstyle. It was all the rage.\n\n\nOne of the most fun activities I did back home was playing boardgames. Here’s one of Cedric losing to me because I put the word “verzande” (e.g., verzande bedding) for a score of 96 points. And all of this because he wouldn’t let me play quenya. Little bean comes for his little wage.\n\n\nBut spite aside, I had such a great time. So great that in my last days I took yet another railway company-sponsored trip to Ghent, to visit Cedric and Isabelle. Here is us at the fortress that occupies the middle of the city.\n\n\nI mentioned Ruben before, and that brings me to when the twins visited me in our little village, and we could enter the little chapel! Lucky us. Here’s camerashy yet expert photographer Ruben’s picture of the inside of the chapel.\n\n\nBut I did meet up with Ruben once more as well, together with another friend of ours, Margaux, whose wedding was so beautiful a few trips to Belgium ago. This is a covidproof picture of Margaux and her sister (Margaux is also my dentist).\n\n\nAnd here are Margaux, her hubby Kristof and their daughter Emma, and Ruben, and me on the Kalmthoutse Heide, drinking cava on the heath. Hashtag #heathcliffitsmecathy\n\n\nI have some fond memories of the Kalmthoutse Heath. For instance, one time we did a sponsored 10K trek for charity when I was in primary school. But that was a spring time (don’t go there in summer; the heath tends to be ablaze then); now is winter. There was a solemn beauty emanating from the seemingly endless stretches of grassy patches. Very beautiful.\n\n\nOne of the other first groups I got to see where my classmates from Sinology, way back when by now. We went to our favorite local restaurant in Leuven, De Werf (the construction site), where we reminisced about the good old student times and also talked about what everybody had been up to. Well, I guess, it was mostly me who wanted to know because being away for so long made me lose touch to some degree. Here’s a covidian photograph.\n\n\nAnd because Mandy couldn’t join us, I decided to become her cuddle contact (knuffelcontact) and visited her little family in their new home. If you visit Mandy, you never go home hungry, nor angry. Not even hangry. Here’s a picture of us in the first 5% of their long garden.\n\n\n\n\nMeeting with family\nOf course I got to see some family members – yet not as many as I had wanted (My family is actually kind of large, like, at least 13 cousins +- 2). Anyway, here is the “small side” of the family. Picture taken with social distancing rules in mind.\n\n\nI also got to hang out with my dad quite a few times. For instance, here we went to the Schorre, where every year (well I guess not in 2020 and probably neither in 2021) they do Tomorrowland. I guess people will just have to turn on youtube and watch their own computer play songs. The site, however, was kinda magical. They put up these giants on the domain. Here is a picture of me pointing at a giant who is pointing at the stars. That day became a bit of an ad astra per aspera because I tripped and my foot hurt for a few weeks after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat last picture was also taken on the same site, but it looks completely different right?! There was a watchtower whence one could observe the Atomium, the Belgian equivalent of the Eiffel tower. My dad says he frequently rides his mountainbike from this ledge.\nOf course, most time I spent at home with my mom. And because it became a kind of everyday comfort, I don’t have that many pictures. But I thoroughly enjoyed the TV shows we binged together, the meals we shared and the daily routine I found myself in. Except for vacuuming. But on the other hand, my mom became a proish barrista, whipping up lattes left and right.\n\n\n\n\nMost pictures of her also feature our new dog Whoopi, named after Caryn Elain Johnson.\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah, the rest of this section is just going to be Whoopictures. For instance, Whoopi discovered she likes the armrest of the sofa.\n\n\nAnd she likes biting my hand, for fun of course.\n\n\nShe loves lying on her back.\n\n\nOr sleeping with her body on my shoulder, as if I were a pirate and she my parrot.\n\n\nShe discovered the power of blankets™️.\n\n\nAnd she has this stuffed sloth, what we call her Aapje. Everyday she brings over her Aapje to play with.\n\n\nPoetic intermezzo: Spleen\n\nIk zit mij voor het vensterglas\nonnoemlijk te vervelen.\nIk wou dat ik twee hondjes was,\ndan kon ik samen spelen.\n\n\n\nOne time I was walking her and she saw her own reflection and we had to stand there for an uncomfortably long time. This is a nice segue into the next section.\n\n\n\n\nA reappraisal of my hometown\nThere is something powerful in the notion of being home, but often this sentiment only emerges when you’re away from home. Just like so many other things, the feelings attached to it are only noticed in its absence. Musically it has inspired one of my favorite albums and also a song I like to perform in the confined space of a Taiwanese karaoke room.\nNostalgic intro aside, the ongoing pandemic made it hard for me to do a lot of things apart from taking daily walks with my dog. But they were good opportunities for rediscovering the countryside of Loenhout. Because my self-imposed sabbatical basically was planned for 4 months but was made longer due to certain factors I got to stay 5 months, and see how my home transformed from summer to autumn to winter.\nFrom the castle of Loenhout (btw I have a friend who owns a carpet that came from that castle!), to a first breezy walk, to a walk between the flower fields. A pity they weren’t used in the yearly flower parade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI kind of forgot what autumn looked like because we don’t do that in Taiwan, nor Hong Kong. Here are some beautiful trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne season later, the same street gets a completely different look. But I appreciate all, having walked there almost every day.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of the most fun things was being able to (wow that is some serious academic sentential elongating) (re)discover nice roads to walk on. Like the sports fields – supposedly on a larger terrain than the training field of Real Madrid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got to see beautiful sunrises and sunsets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got to experience the quiet of the countryside at night (okay there was a curfew which helped) and went to places to actually find some stillness, such as the alley behind a local school, full moons through bare trees, a circular graveyard for nuns, and the place where my grandfather’s ashes were enterred last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatome\nMatome is Japanese for ‘conclusion’. Somehow it feels fitting. I am thankful for the period, longer than anticipated, that I could spend at home. It gave me some much needed time to just be and only do light work after the stress of finishing my dissertation. I appreciate the thought of being home even more and knew that I needed to say goodbye yet again. But this time I would be taking a much deeper part of it with me, a somewhat unexpected side effect of covid and being forced to turn inwards.\nThe final pictures are of my (ex?-)municipal center, het Gemeentehuis van Wuustwezel, also in a former castle, has become a vestige for my time spent growing up and leaving the nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTowards new adventures!"

    "text": "I’m writing this post from my compulsory quarantine hotel in Hong Kong, where I started my postdoctoral fellowship this month. However, by being secluded from the outside–I literally cannot open the window and take a breath of fresh air, luckily the air conditioning system is working optimally–has made me realize how much I have missed just being in Belgium at home during my PhD in Taiwan. Here are some moments that have stood out for me.\n\nMeeting friends\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, and Belgium’s less than optimal situation, I only managed to see perhaps a tenth of the people I was looking forward to meet. Luckily, I did get to meet the ones I met, and I want other people to know that I did yearn for meeting up with them, but unfortunately the situation become worse over time, resulting in nasty measures like the closing of restaurants and bars, museums, or almost anything really.\nThe first friend I met up with was Cedric, who took me to the “city” where we went to high school together.\n\n\nThe next time I saw him, he brought my dear old classmate and his dear old twin brother Ruben, who were just stopping by for a socially distanced hi.\n\n\nLater on I would visit Cedric in Brussels, where we went to the museums (after they opened again in January!). It was also an opportunity to use the free train tickets that Belgium government made the national railway company give to each citizen that wanted one. Of course, Belgium’s gonna Belge, and the railway company made it so that you had 12 free trips (hooray!), but divided over six months with two trips per month, basically reducing the value of such a gift to nothing. Still, it took me to Brussels, the capital. This is Cedric and me on the Grand Place, not far from Manneken Pis, which was too small to take a good picture of. Also, please don’t mind the coronacoupe hairstyle. It was all the rage.\n\n\nOne of the most fun activities I did back home was playing boardgames. Here’s one of Cedric losing to me because I put the word “verzande” (e.g., verzande bedding) for a score of 96 points. And all of this because he wouldn’t let me play quenya. Little bean comes for his little wage.\n\n\nBut spite aside, I had such a great time. So great that in my last days I took yet another railway company-sponsored trip to Ghent, to visit Cedric and Isabelle. Here is us at the fortress that occupies the middle of the city.\n\n\nI mentioned Ruben before, and that brings me to when the twins visited me in our little village, and we could enter the little chapel! Lucky us. Here’s camerashy yet expert photographer Ruben’s picture of the inside of the chapel.\n\n\nBut I did meet up with Ruben once more as well, together with another friend of ours, Margaux, whose wedding was so beautiful a few trips to Belgium ago. This is a covidproof picture of Margaux and her sister (Margaux is also my dentist).\n\n\nAnd here are Margaux, her hubby Kristof and their daughter Emma, and Ruben, and me on the Kalmthoutse Heide, drinking cava on the heath. Hashtag #heathcliffitsmecathy\n\n\nI have some fond memories of the Kalmthoutse Heath. For instance, one time we did a sponsored 10K trek for charity when I was in primary school. But that was a spring time (don’t go there in summer; the heath tends to be ablaze then); now is winter. There was a solemn beauty emanating from the seemingly endless stretches of grassy patches. Very beautiful.\n\n\nOne of the other first groups I got to see where my classmates from Sinology, way back when by now. We went to our favorite local restaurant in Leuven, De Werf (the construction site), where we reminisced about the good old student times and also talked about what everybody had been up to. Well, I guess, it was mostly me who wanted to know because being away for so long made me lose touch to some degree. Here’s a covidian photograph.\n\n\nAnd because Mandy couldn’t join us, I decided to become her cuddle contact (knuffelcontact) and visited her little family in their new home. If you visit Mandy, you never go home hungry, nor angry. Not even hangry. Here’s a picture of us in the first 5% of their long garden.\n\n\n\n\nMeeting with family\nOf course I got to see some family members – yet not as many as I had wanted (My family is actually kind of large, like, at least 13 cousins +- 2). Anyway, here is the “small side” of the family. Picture taken with social distancing rules in mind.\n\n\nI also got to hang out with my dad quite a few times. For instance, here we went to the Schorre, where every year (well I guess not in 2020 and probably neither in 2021) they do Tomorrowland. I guess people will just have to turn on youtube and watch their own computer play songs. The site, however, was kinda magical. They put up these giants on the domain. Here is a picture of me pointing at a giant who is pointing at the stars. That day became a bit of an ad astra per aspera because I tripped and my foot hurt for a few weeks after.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat last picture was also taken on the same site, but it looks completely different right?! There was a watchtower whence one could observe the Atomium, the Belgian equivalent of the Eiffel tower. My dad says he frequently rides his mountainbike from this ledge.\nOf course, most time I spent at home with my mom. And because it became a kind of everyday comfort, I don’t have that many pictures. But I thoroughly enjoyed the TV shows we binged together, the meals we shared and the daily routine I found myself in. Except for vacuuming. But on the other hand, my mom became a proish barrista, whipping up lattes left and right.\n\n\n\n\nMost pictures of her also feature our new dog Whoopi, named after Caryn Elain Johnson.\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah, the rest of this section is just going to be Whoopictures. For instance, Whoopi discovered she likes the armrest of the sofa.\n\n\nAnd she likes biting my hand, for fun of course.\n\n\nShe loves lying on her back.\n\n\nOr sleeping with her body on my shoulder, as if I were a pirate and she my parrot.\n\n\nShe discovered the power of blankets™️.\n\n\nAnd she has this stuffed sloth, what we call her Aapje. Everyday she brings over her Aapje to play with.\n\n\nPoetic intermezzo: Spleen\n\nIk zit mij voor het vensterglas\nonnoemlijk te vervelen.\nIk wou dat ik twee hondjes was,\ndan kon ik samen spelen.\n\n\n\nOne time I was walking her and she saw her own reflection and we had to stand there for an uncomfortably long time. This is a nice segue into the next section.\n\n\n\n\nA reappraisal of my hometown\nThere is something powerful in the notion of being home, but often this sentiment only emerges when you’re away from home. Just like so many other things, the feelings attached to it are only noticed in its absence. Musically it has inspired one of my favorite albums and also a song I like to perform in the confined space of a Taiwanese karaoke room.\nNostalgic intro aside, the ongoing pandemic made it hard for me to do a lot of things apart from taking daily walks with my dog. But they were good opportunities for rediscovering the countryside of Loenhout. Because my self-imposed sabbatical basically was planned for 4 months but was made longer due to certain factors I got to stay 5 months, and see how my home transformed from summer to autumn to winter.\nFrom the castle of Loenhout (btw I have a friend who owns a carpet that came from that castle!), to a first breezy walk, to a walk between the flower fields. A pity they weren’t used in the yearly flower parade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI kind of forgot what autumn looked like because we don’t do that in Taiwan, nor Hong Kong. Here are some beautiful trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne season later, the same street gets a completely different look. But I appreciate all, having walked there almost every day.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of the most fun things was being able to (wow that is some serious academic sentential elongating) (re)discover nice roads to walk on. Like the sports fields – supposedly on a larger terrain than the training field of Real Madrid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got to see beautiful sunrises and sunsets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got to experience the quiet of the countryside at night (okay there was a curfew which helped) and went to places to actually find some stillness, such as the alley behind a local school, full moons through bare trees, a circular graveyard for nuns, and the place where my grandfather’s ashes were enterred last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatome\nMatome is Japanese for ‘conclusion’. Somehow it feels fitting. I am thankful for the period, longer than anticipated, that I could spend at home. It gave me some much needed time to just be and only do light work after the stress of finishing my dissertation. I appreciate the thought of being home even more and knew that I needed to say goodbye yet again. But this time I would be taking a much deeper part of it with me, a somewhat unexpected side effect of covid and being forced to turn inwards.\nThe final pictures are of my (ex?-)municipal center, het Gemeentehuis van Wuustwezel, also in a former castle, has become a vestige for my time spent growing up and leaving the nest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTowards new adventures!"

    "text": "One of the basic skills people, but PhD students and academics in particular, need to cultivate is sharpening their research workflow. You need to cultivate this by just doing it, but also by reviewing it from time to time. In this update, I’ll talk about a new app that has entered my life and made note-taking better: Obsidian (not a paid sponsorship, just me sharing my thoughts).\n\nGeneral note structure\nI’ve written about this research workflow before (here and here). In the second post I outlined a method for taking notes and basically still use it to this day:\n\nMake sure Zotero has the right entry.\nExport a bibliography (Unified Linguistics Stylesheet FTW~~)\nOpen a note in the note-taking app.\nMake an entry that looks like this in markdown\n\n\nSHORT REFERENCE (exported from Zotero but shortened)\n\nFULL REFERENCE (exported from Zotero, just to be sure you get the full reference)\n\nRead: YYYYMMDD\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATION (good / bad paper, useful...)\n\n---\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PAPER\nQUOTES\nWHATEVER YOU WANT TO TAKE FROM THIS PAPER FOR THE FUTURE YOU\nThere are quite a few people that will tell you how to take notes content-wise, but I’m here to tell you about my system. The way people take notes is highly individualized, especially in terms of what you actually jot down, and it often really depends on the paper. If it’s a very graphical paper then I would like to add a lot of screenshots or other figures; if it’s just a “oh yeah this exists” paper, then that is what I note and move on with my life.\n\n\nBut what software?\nSoftware-wise, I still don’t think it’s a good idea to keep all your notes in MS Word, but instead look for a way to ensure the longevity of your notes. This video by Nicholas Cifuentes-Goodbody was very influential for me many years ago and I urge you to watch it if you are still stuck waiting for Word to open. Also the slogan in this blog: “Your academic life in plain text”, or this informative blog. If this video and blog appeal to you, you may want to invest in learning markdown. I think at most it will take you 20 minutes that will change your life, as advertised here.\nBut what do you write markdown in? Like many students of my generation, I started with Evernote, the elephant that promised to help us remember everything. I still think Evernote is a pretty good app for general grabbing and storing, because it has adapted for everything. However, their unwillingness to make a simple native (read: free) markdown editor for a thousand years or so (okay the past five years) has made many people jump the ship, and so did I.\nIn 2018 (I think) I came across an app called Notable, the brainchild of 1 person, which had the catchy slogan of being “the markdown-based note-taking app that doesn’t suck”. Basically, it was shown that having markdown (.md) files locally on your computer, which you can keep in the cloud, is a fast and reliable way of taking notes, because you’re not locked into an ecosystem (like Evernote but also lots of popular productivity apps). I became convinced that this is what I needed and I am happy I moved away from Evernote to Notable. Somewhat in awe I watched every update over the past few years, like the integration of figures, split editor, etc.\nBut while the progress of Fabio is admirable and the reddit community is great, I was enticed twice recently to make another switch.\nThe first enticement was Roam Research but after seeing its exorbitant prices for an extremely new app (165 dollars per year, yuck), I was looking for an alternative and found Obsidian (free for personal use), which is backed by a team of highly motivated people that were either “inspired” by Notable or in a case of convergent evolution developed the same idea that notes should be kept on your own system.\nBut where it really shines is the backlinking and network visualization of notes, a feature that Roam also excels at and can be implemented in Notable (but is not super well-supported), and I guess it was enough to take the jump and try Obsidian out.\n\n\nMigrating from Notable to Obsidian with R\nAs always, I started with an Rproject, so I can sync it to github (private folder though ✌️). In that folder, I have a subfolder ‘academic_notes’ with all the notes and a subfolder ‘attachments’ for all the figures. Next, I just copied everything from my local Notable folder to the new academic_notes folder.\nThe hardest part was writing a small R-script to change all ![](@attachment/NAME) from Notable to the form ![[NAME]], so that all figures could be rendered in Obsidian.\n\n\nStructuring my notes\nJust to give you an impression, I have some 700 notes with details as outlined above. This does not represent everything I have ever read, but a good chunk of it. However, in Notable, I just had a flat structure, like this one:\n\n\n\nflat structure\n\n\nWow, what a clusterfuck. If we zoom out we can see that every note is represented by a dot. Using the handy backlinking system [[TERM YOU WANT TO TAG]] with the square brackets, you can start linking notes together.\n\n\n\nfirst structure\n\n\nI had quite a bit of fun with manually going through my notes, checking for links and adding unlinked data to the network:\n\n\n\nadding manual links\n\n\nBut then I suddenly saw the R-light! I thought, let’s do this programmatically and thematically. So I wrote a dirty script to read in every file and add the double square brackets for every term that I wanted.\nFor example, if I wanted to link all words that have “ideophone” together, this is what I wrote:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(here)\n\n\n\nfiles &lt;- dir_ls(here(\"academic_notes\"),\n                regexp = \".md$\")\n\nadd_backlink &lt;- function(file){\n  filepad &lt;- file\n  \n  target &lt;- glue(\"(?&lt;!\\\\[)\\\\b{word}s?\\\\b(?!\\\\])\")\n  vervanging &lt;- glue(\"[[{word}]]\")\n\n  read_lines(file) %&gt;% \n      str_replace_all(target, vervanging) %&gt;%\n    write_lines(filepad)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n######################\n# change this variable\nword &lt;- \"ideophone\"\n######################\n\nwalk(files, add_backlink) # actually running things\nAsk me about it if you are interested lol. And if you keep the graph open you can see it changing in real time, which is very satisfying.\n\nObsidian change with R\n\n\n\n\nA network of notes\nAnd then finally, we get a better representation of the notes that intersect in certain topics. I believe this can help me to write better surveys of the literature. But for now it’s mostly pretty to look at. Good luck trying this out and if you have a different workflow, I’d happily learn about it!\n\n\n\nnotes related to ‘ideophone’\n\n\n\n\n\nnotes related to ‘chinese’"

    "text": "Wow! It has already been one month (to the day) since my Taiwan adventure ended and I came back to Belgium. High time I publish the third installment of my graduation blogs (part 1 and part 2).\n\n“So when are you graduating?”\nOne of the questions that PhD students do not like hearing is “so when are you graduating?”. In many programs, there might be a fixed duration, but the actual date of finishing stays unclear until the end. This often has to do with the progress of a PhD candidate within a program or the relation with the supervisor, but it can also be hard to answer due to unclear milestones that succeed one another rapidly near the end.\nFor me, I knew I hadn’t graduated when I delivered my intellectual baby (see part 2). The next milestone, the PhD defense, feels much more like an initiation ritual: you’re being asked questions about your research and essentially get the stamp of approval from your committee. And if all goes well and you pass, you become the newest member of PhD holders. But you still haven’t graduated. There is the official graduation ceremony–of which I am so glad that it could still happen in-person in this COVID-laden year in Taiwan– and yes that is also a milestone.\nHowever, by then I still didn’t have my degree. So had I actually graduated? I kept asking myself this somewhat existential question from time to time during this year’s summer. This also had to do with the revisions that were needed for my dissertation.\nAs a quick note, it is very customary for PhD dissertations to pass with amazing grades and still need to undergo some revisions, ranging from minor things to major revisions or even being failed. Luckily mine did pass with pretty great grades (A+) but I still was asked to rework some parts substantially, which i happily did. As I have often heard\n\nThe only good dissertation is a finished dissertation.\n\nThe deadline of submitting this revised version (which should pass along your advisor) was 20 August 2020. And actually it’s earlier, as you also need to get your uploaded version accepted by a team of librarians, who probably are swamped with work around this deadline. My first submission into the system, which I had spent a few hours getting the right formatting for, came back a day later with notes for issues that they had not clearly outlined in their instructions. So I spent a few hours making the necessary changes and clicked submit again, hoping for the best. Yes, the second time it did go through and I could print–yet another source of potential stress within a week of the looming deadline. Luckily, the lady from the print shop was extremely friendly and professional, and within just a few hours (!!!! Belgium take note !!!!) I had my copies to submit to the library and the department–yet another milestone that is part of graduating (which I completed on the 20th of August). I should also make the side note that I had to provide 1 copy for NTU library, one for my department, and one for the National Library. Yes, you can check out my dissertation in the National Library of Taiwan. Here is a picture of the 20th of August, when I ran into my friend Amirah who incicentally went to submit her dissertation as well.\n\n\nIt was just a bit before this time that I heard that there is actually a checklist of stuff you need to do to leave school (離校), available in the online administration system. And this involved lots of trips around different offices. For instance, to leave my dorm, I needed three signatures and a trip to the office of student housing; for leaving Taiwan, I needed to let the office of international affairs know that I could be scrapped from the national insurance program (very good medical insurance program though!)… And so I rediscovered the campus I had spent five years, going from hot to her. A complication about this list in my case was that I could only finish the list at the end of August, because I was still under contract as a research assistant.\nSo the 28th I finally finished the checklist, went to yet another office, and FINALLY GOT MY DEGREE! My student card was stamped as invalid (this is a good thing) and I also was able to get my alumni card. Here is a picture of my invalidated student ID and my alumni card, both with an extremely old picture–nobody had told me during my application that the picture I sent in would be used for this purpose 🤷🏼‍♂️️️.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think that the question of when you actually graduate a PhD program is manifestly multifold. For me personally, I felt most graduated (yes graduating is a feeling) in the aftermath of my defense, when I attended the ceremony, when I went to submit my dissertation to the library and when I got my actual degree. But the most nerve-wrecking is definitely the first of these.\nNow, in the last weeks of my time in Taiwan, I also decided to print a more luxurious version of my thesis, with the older official formatting. I’m talking black hardcover and golden letters. Below you can see the four stages my pie of research went through: the Proposal version, the Defense version, the Library version and finally the Memorial version.\n\n\nThis fancy version I had printed 10 times, all about 600 NTD, so that means the price was extremely reasonable for an eventually 520 or so page-long document. Five were for my advisor and other committee members, 1 was for myself, and 4 were for interested parties that helped me a lot during my studies. Here is me handing it over to my advisor. I am grateful to Dr. Chiarung Lu for taking me on and the academic freedom in these years, and also all the advice she gave to me. 謝謝老師.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummertime sadness\nWhile these somewhat stressful events were playing out, I of course was also realizing that the end of Taiwan time was drawing near–an experience that must be similar to that of the Elves in Lord of the Rings, who are fading away into the West. That being said, I had a great summer, spending lots of time with CJ and going places, like Taichung or restaurants and cafés we loved going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as I booked my plane ticket – not an easy feat in times of corona – at the end of August, I also got a date of departure: 11 September (yes, that 9/11, but don’t worry, when I flew it was still 9/10 in America). This also meant lots of saying goodbye to people, like the other alumni of my department.\n\n\nOr our friend Marco, who is also off doing a PhD.\n\n\nOr a group of selected Belgians in Taiwan (we had mussels from Matzu!), including Ann, Rik and Zouk.\n\n\nOr Iju and Emily.\n\n\nOr Rik, Siaw-Fong and Taco.\n\n\nOr the ladies from the international office (who I still know from my summer school).\n\n\nOr my friends from the summer school in 2014: Snow, Franzi, Lucy and Laurence.\n\n\nOr my buddy Wen-Lin.\n\n\nOr my reporter friend Erin.\n\n\nOr my (almost adopted?) Taiwanese family 💖️.\n\n\nOr my colleague-classmate Alex.\n\n\nOr my hairdresser for the past five years.\n\n\nOr my coding bodybuilder friend Richard.\n\n\nBut a most magical evening was my goodbye party. It was not in a fancy location, but the people who came really made my day. I am so grateful for my time at NTU and want to keep in touch with these people forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also needed to leave my dorm–that place with the amazing view that I might never get again. Discarding of most of my stuff, either to the other dorm people or by throwing it away, and storing some books at CJ’s place made my room suddenly feel so empty. I remember in the last moments of my last days, I went to the rooftop and sat with myself, taking this radical change in. By moving out, I really was saying goodbye to a part of myself: Thomas the PhD student. Here is a picture of me letting that thought get to me.\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Day\nAfter CJ also had left (back to the USA for his PhD), I stayed a few days in a hotel, while trying to wrap up what needed wrapping up, mostly administrative stuff. On my penultimate day, I had a job interview (more about that soo). On my last day, I checked out and tried to use the city check-in. Unfortunately, due to COVID and a stupid rule concerning my trekking backpack, I couldn’t do it in the city, but actually had to travel all the way to Sanchong to drop my stuff off. They weighed my luggage, which of course was too heavy, so they had me transfer a number of books into my carry-on luggage. After losing way too much time, I had a hair appointment. That also ran out and I was also late for my next appointment: a lunch date with my advisor and student-colleague Adrw. I had a wonderful time and got a goodbye gift – Taiwanese facemasks and a Japanese handkerchief, which I really appreciate.\n\n\nAfter my hectic day so far, I had a few hours in the eye of the storm. That meant I needed to go back to school and make sure my desk was empty. In the evening I had a great last dinner with Iju, who also escorted me to the airport MRT.\n\n\nAnd when I got to the airport, I knew that I would be taking the same plane as the person who was in charge of the summer school I was into all those years ago, Jungchen. So in a crazy twist of fate, my Taiwan adventure had come full circle.\n\n\nSo yeah, then it was time to say goodbye to Taiwan, and hello to Holland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, I was so happy to see my parents again. Home."

    "text": "One gnarly problem I sometimes face is that when I transfer pictures from my phone to my computer, the metadata says that the date the picture was taken is actually the date the file was created on my computer. In other words, the date is wrong. This has bad consequences for photography software that reads the metadata and sorts them by date taken (like Flickr does for me).\nThe problem is illustrated here in this screenshot. We can infer from the name of the file that it was taken on the 5th of September, while the creation date in my computer is today (30th of September).\n\nLuckily, with R it’s not hard to get the correct metadata. There are two possible routes. The first one concerns real pictures, which actually still have the correct metadata hidden within the file; the second one is for screenshots, which maybe have the wanted date in the filename, but which don’t have intrinsic metadata.\nReady, set, go.\n\nPackages\n\n# general packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # our swiss army knife\nlibrary(fs) # reading in files in a tidyish way\nlibrary(lubridate) # working with dates \n\n# specialized packages\nlibrary(exifr) # for reading photo metadata\n\nApart from the general rstudio-like packages like tidyverse, fs, glue and lubridate, we need a specialized package exifr (github) for reading EXIF metadata attached to pictures. exifr extracts these metadata and can output them in a nice dataframe. Specifically we are interested in the variable “DateTimeOriginal”.\n\n\nRoute 1: getting DateTimeOriginal and changing the creation date.\n\n# reading in all the different pictures we need to treat in batch\nfiles &lt;- dir_ls(\"PATH TO FOLDER WHERE PICTURES ARE STORED\",\n                recurse = TRUE,\n                regexp = \".jpg$\")\n\n\n# defining a function\nchange_file_create_date &lt;- function(afb){\n  # get correct exif date\n  read_exif(path = afb,\n            tags = c(\"DateTimeOriginal\")) %&gt;%\n    pull(DateTimeOriginal) %&gt;%\n    parse_date_time(\"Ymd HMS\", \n                    tz = \"Asia/Taipei\" #timezone\n                    ) -&gt; correct_time\n\n  # changing the creation date\n  Sys.setFileTime(afb, correct_time)\n  \n}\n\n\n# run the function over all the different files\npurrr::walk(files, change_file_create_date)\n\n\n\nRoute 2: pulling the date from filename and changing the creation date.\nScreenshots on my computer, which is configured in Dutch, have the following filename.\nSchermafbeelding 2020-09-30-09-38-32.png\nSo that means “SCREENSHOT DATE-TIME.png”. The date and time can be foudn with a fairly simple regular expression, namely:\n'4 NUMBERS' FOLLOWED BY FIVE TIMES THE SEQUENCE '-2 NUMBERS'\nIn R code that is written like:\n\\\\d{4}(-\\\\d\\\\d){5}\nAnd then we’re set. Just adapt the function definition in the middle and run it over the files we want to change.\n\n# read in files\nfiles &lt;- dir_ls(\"PATH TO FOLDER WHERE PICTURES ARE STORED\",\n                recurse = TRUE,\n                regexp = \".jpg$\")\n\n# function definition\nchange_file_create_date &lt;- function(afb){\n\n  # get correct date from filename\n  afb %&gt;%\n    as.character() %&gt;%\n    str_extract(\"\\\\d{4}(-\\\\d\\\\d){5}\")  %&gt;%\n    parse_date_time(\"YmdHMS\", \n                      tz = \"Asia/Taipei\" #timezone\n                    ) -&gt; correct_time\n  \n  # changing the creation date\n  Sys.setFileTime(afb, correct_time)\n  \n}\n\n\n# run the function over all the different files\nwalk(files, change_file_create_date)\n\nAnd there we have it, based on the correct regular expression, we can batch process these without much effort.\n\nAnd should you be wondering, this is the picture we were trying to change, with the nice message from my friends in zhuyin: I❤️U ㄚㄓˋ."

    "text": "Wow! It has already been one month (to the day) since my Taiwan adventure ended and I came back to Belgium. High time I publish the third installment of my graduation blogs (part 1 and part 2).\n\n“So when are you graduating?”\nOne of the questions that PhD students do not like hearing is “so when are you graduating?”. In many programs, there might be a fixed duration, but the actual date of finishing stays unclear until the end. This often has to do with the progress of a PhD candidate within a program or the relation with the supervisor, but it can also be hard to answer due to unclear milestones that succeed one another rapidly near the end.\nFor me, I knew I hadn’t graduated when I delivered my intellectual baby (see part 2). The next milestone, the PhD defense, feels much more like an initiation ritual: you’re being asked questions about your research and essentially get the stamp of approval from your committee. And if all goes well and you pass, you become the newest member of PhD holders. But you still haven’t graduated. There is the official graduation ceremony–of which I am so glad that it could still happen in-person in this COVID-laden year in Taiwan– and yes that is also a milestone.\nHowever, by then I still didn’t have my degree. So had I actually graduated? I kept asking myself this somewhat existential question from time to time during this year’s summer. This also had to do with the revisions that were needed for my dissertation.\nAs a quick note, it is very customary for PhD dissertations to pass with amazing grades and still need to undergo some revisions, ranging from minor things to major revisions or even being failed. Luckily mine did pass with pretty great grades (A+) but I still was asked to rework some parts substantially, which i happily did. As I have often heard\n\nThe only good dissertation is a finished dissertation.\n\nThe deadline of submitting this revised version (which should pass along your advisor) was 20 August 2020. And actually it’s earlier, as you also need to get your uploaded version accepted by a team of librarians, who probably are swamped with work around this deadline. My first submission into the system, which I had spent a few hours getting the right formatting for, came back a day later with notes for issues that they had not clearly outlined in their instructions. So I spent a few hours making the necessary changes and clicked submit again, hoping for the best. Yes, the second time it did go through and I could print–yet another source of potential stress within a week of the looming deadline. Luckily, the lady from the print shop was extremely friendly and professional, and within just a few hours (!!!! Belgium take note !!!!) I had my copies to submit to the library and the department–yet another milestone that is part of graduating (which I completed on the 20th of August). I should also make the side note that I had to provide 1 copy for NTU library, one for my department, and one for the National Library. Yes, you can check out my dissertation in the National Library of Taiwan. Here is a picture of the 20th of August, when I ran into my friend Amirah who incicentally went to submit her dissertation as well.\n\n\nIt was just a bit before this time that I heard that there is actually a checklist of stuff you need to do to leave school (離校), available in the online administration system. And this involved lots of trips around different offices. For instance, to leave my dorm, I needed three signatures and a trip to the office of student housing; for leaving Taiwan, I needed to let the office of international affairs know that I could be scrapped from the national insurance program (very good medical insurance program though!)… And so I rediscovered the campus I had spent five years, going from hot to her. A complication about this list in my case was that I could only finish the list at the end of August, because I was still under contract as a research assistant.\nSo the 28th I finally finished the checklist, went to yet another office, and FINALLY GOT MY DEGREE! My student card was stamped as invalid (this is a good thing) and I also was able to get my alumni card. Here is a picture of my invalidated student ID and my alumni card, both with an extremely old picture–nobody had told me during my application that the picture I sent in would be used for this purpose 🤷🏼‍♂️️️.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think that the question of when you actually graduate a PhD program is manifestly multifold. For me personally, I felt most graduated (yes graduating is a feeling) in the aftermath of my defense, when I attended the ceremony, when I went to submit my dissertation to the library and when I got my actual degree. But the most nerve-wrecking is definitely the first of these.\nNow, in the last weeks of my time in Taiwan, I also decided to print a more luxurious version of my thesis, with the older official formatting. I’m talking black hardcover and golden letters. Below you can see the four stages my pie of research went through: the Proposal version, the Defense version, the Library version and finally the Memorial version.\n\n\nThis fancy version I had printed 10 times, all about 600 NTD, so that means the price was extremely reasonable for an eventually 520 or so page-long document. Five were for my advisor and other committee members, 1 was for myself, and 4 were for interested parties that helped me a lot during my studies. Here is me handing it over to my advisor. I am grateful to Dr. Chiarung Lu for taking me on and the academic freedom in these years, and also all the advice she gave to me. 謝謝老師.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummertime sadness\nWhile these somewhat stressful events were playing out, I of course was also realizing that the end of Taiwan time was drawing near–an experience that must be similar to that of the Elves in Lord of the Rings, who are fading away into the West. That being said, I had a great summer, spending lots of time with CJ and going places, like Taichung or restaurants and cafés we loved going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as I booked my plane ticket – not an easy feat in times of corona – at the end of August, I also got a date of departure: 11 September (yes, that 9/11, but don’t worry, when I flew it was still 9/10 in America). This also meant lots of saying goodbye to people, like the other alumni of my department.\n\n\nOr our friend Marco, who is also off doing a PhD.\n\n\nOr a group of selected Belgians in Taiwan (we had mussels from Matzu!), including Ann, Rik and Zouk.\n\n\nOr Iju and Emily.\n\n\nOr Rik, Siaw-Fong and Taco.\n\n\nOr the ladies from the international office (who I still know from my summer school).\n\n\nOr my friends from the summer school in 2014: Snow, Franzi, Lucy and Laurence.\n\n\nOr my buddy Wen-Lin.\n\n\nOr my reporter friend Erin.\n\n\nOr my (almost adopted?) Taiwanese family 💖️.\n\n\nOr my colleague-classmate Alex.\n\n\nOr my hairdresser for the past five years.\n\n\nOr my coding bodybuilder friend Richard.\n\n\nBut a most magical evening was my goodbye party. It was not in a fancy location, but the people who came really made my day. I am so grateful for my time at NTU and want to keep in touch with these people forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also needed to leave my dorm–that place with the amazing view that I might never get again. Discarding of most of my stuff, either to the other dorm people or by throwing it away, and storing some books at CJ’s place made my room suddenly feel so empty. I remember in the last moments of my last days, I went to the rooftop and sat with myself, taking this radical change in. By moving out, I really was saying goodbye to a part of myself: Thomas the PhD student. Here is a picture of me letting that thought get to me.\n\n\n\n\nThe Last Day\nAfter CJ also had left (back to the USA for his PhD), I stayed a few days in a hotel, while trying to wrap up what needed wrapping up, mostly administrative stuff. On my penultimate day, I had a job interview (more about that soo). On my last day, I checked out and tried to use the city check-in. Unfortunately, due to COVID and a stupid rule concerning my trekking backpack, I couldn’t do it in the city, but actually had to travel all the way to Sanchong to drop my stuff off. They weighed my luggage, which of course was too heavy, so they had me transfer a number of books into my carry-on luggage. After losing way too much time, I had a hair appointment. That also ran out and I was also late for my next appointment: a lunch date with my advisor and student-colleague Adrw. I had a wonderful time and got a goodbye gift – Taiwanese facemasks and a Japanese handkerchief, which I really appreciate.\n\n\nAfter my hectic day so far, I had a few hours in the eye of the storm. That meant I needed to go back to school and make sure my desk was empty. In the evening I had a great last dinner with Iju, who also escorted me to the airport MRT.\n\n\nAnd when I got to the airport, I knew that I would be taking the same plane as the person who was in charge of the summer school I was into all those years ago, Jungchen. So in a crazy twist of fate, my Taiwan adventure had come full circle.\n\n\nSo yeah, then it was time to say goodbye to Taiwan, and hello to Holland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, I was so happy to see my parents again. Home."

    "text": "One of the basic skills people, but PhD students and academics in particular, need to cultivate is sharpening their research workflow. You need to cultivate this by just doing it, but also by reviewing it from time to time. In this update, I’ll talk about a new app that has entered my life and made note-taking better: Obsidian (not a paid sponsorship, just me sharing my thoughts).\n\nGeneral note structure\nI’ve written about this research workflow before (here and here). In the second post I outlined a method for taking notes and basically still use it to this day:\n\nMake sure Zotero has the right entry.\nExport a bibliography (Unified Linguistics Stylesheet FTW~~)\nOpen a note in the note-taking app.\nMake an entry that looks like this in markdown\n\n\nSHORT REFERENCE (exported from Zotero but shortened)\n\nFULL REFERENCE (exported from Zotero, just to be sure you get the full reference)\n\nRead: YYYYMMDD\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATION (good / bad paper, useful...)\n\n---\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PAPER\nQUOTES\nWHATEVER YOU WANT TO TAKE FROM THIS PAPER FOR THE FUTURE YOU\nThere are quite a few people that will tell you how to take notes content-wise, but I’m here to tell you about my system. The way people take notes is highly individualized, especially in terms of what you actually jot down, and it often really depends on the paper. If it’s a very graphical paper then I would like to add a lot of screenshots or other figures; if it’s just a “oh yeah this exists” paper, then that is what I note and move on with my life.\n\n\nBut what software?\nSoftware-wise, I still don’t think it’s a good idea to keep all your notes in MS Word, but instead look for a way to ensure the longevity of your notes. This video by Nicholas Cifuentes-Goodbody was very influential for me many years ago and I urge you to watch it if you are still stuck waiting for Word to open. Also the slogan in this blog: “Your academic life in plain text”, or this informative blog. If this video and blog appeal to you, you may want to invest in learning markdown. I think at most it will take you 20 minutes that will change your life, as advertised here.\nBut what do you write markdown in? Like many students of my generation, I started with Evernote, the elephant that promised to help us remember everything. I still think Evernote is a pretty good app for general grabbing and storing, because it has adapted for everything. However, their unwillingness to make a simple native (read: free) markdown editor for a thousand years or so (okay the past five years) has made many people jump the ship, and so did I.\nIn 2018 (I think) I came across an app called Notable, the brainchild of 1 person, which had the catchy slogan of being “the markdown-based note-taking app that doesn’t suck”. Basically, it was shown that having markdown (.md) files locally on your computer, which you can keep in the cloud, is a fast and reliable way of taking notes, because you’re not locked into an ecosystem (like Evernote but also lots of popular productivity apps). I became convinced that this is what I needed and I am happy I moved away from Evernote to Notable. Somewhat in awe I watched every update over the past few years, like the integration of figures, split editor, etc.\nBut while the progress of Fabio is admirable and the reddit community is great, I was enticed twice recently to make another switch.\nThe first enticement was Roam Research but after seeing its exorbitant prices for an extremely new app (165 dollars per year, yuck), I was looking for an alternative and found Obsidian (free for personal use), which is backed by a team of highly motivated people that were either “inspired” by Notable or in a case of convergent evolution developed the same idea that notes should be kept on your own system.\nBut where it really shines is the backlinking and network visualization of notes, a feature that Roam also excels at and can be implemented in Notable (but is not super well-supported), and I guess it was enough to take the jump and try Obsidian out.\n\n\nMigrating from Notable to Obsidian with R\nAs always, I started with an Rproject, so I can sync it to github (private folder though ✌️). In that folder, I have a subfolder ‘academic_notes’ with all the notes and a subfolder ‘attachments’ for all the figures. Next, I just copied everything from my local Notable folder to the new academic_notes folder.\nThe hardest part was writing a small R-script to change all ![](@attachment/NAME) from Notable to the form ![[NAME]], so that all figures could be rendered in Obsidian.\n\n\nStructuring my notes\nJust to give you an impression, I have some 700 notes with details as outlined above. This does not represent everything I have ever read, but a good chunk of it. However, in Notable, I just had a flat structure, like this one:\n\n\n\nflat structure\n\n\nWow, what a clusterfuck. If we zoom out we can see that every note is represented by a dot. Using the handy backlinking system [[TERM YOU WANT TO TAG]] with the square brackets, you can start linking notes together.\n\n\n\nfirst structure\n\n\nI had quite a bit of fun with manually going through my notes, checking for links and adding unlinked data to the network:\n\n\n\nadding manual links\n\n\nBut then I suddenly saw the R-light! I thought, let’s do this programmatically and thematically. So I wrote a dirty script to read in every file and add the double square brackets for every term that I wanted.\nFor example, if I wanted to link all words that have “ideophone” together, this is what I wrote:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(here)\n\n\n\nfiles &lt;- dir_ls(here(\"academic_notes\"),\n                regexp = \".md$\")\n\nadd_backlink &lt;- function(file){\n  filepad &lt;- file\n  \n  target &lt;- glue(\"(?&lt;!\\\\[)\\\\b{word}s?\\\\b(?!\\\\])\")\n  vervanging &lt;- glue(\"[[{word}]]\")\n\n  read_lines(file) %&gt;% \n      str_replace_all(target, vervanging) %&gt;%\n    write_lines(filepad)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n######################\n# change this variable\nword &lt;- \"ideophone\"\n######################\n\nwalk(files, add_backlink) # actually running things\nAsk me about it if you are interested lol. And if you keep the graph open you can see it changing in real time, which is very satisfying.\n\nObsidian change with R\n\n\n\n\nA network of notes\nAnd then finally, we get a better representation of the notes that intersect in certain topics. I believe this can help me to write better surveys of the literature. But for now it’s mostly pretty to look at. Good luck trying this out and if you have a different workflow, I’d happily learn about it!\n\n\n\nnotes related to ‘ideophone’\n\n\n\n\n\nnotes related to ‘chinese’"

    "text": "Glossing\nGlossing is part and parcel in linguistics. Part of our training is learning to represent linguistic data in a format that can be understood by all. An example can be found in below, taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules. In general, morphemes should correspond, being marked by a hyphen or space to separate them, depending on boundedness. The details are highly dependent on your subfield and your audience. For instance, ‘1PL’ (first plural pronoun) could also be represented by ‘we’ in certain contexts. On other occasions, categories of the language you’re studying are not included in the standard Leipzig Glossing Rules set, e.g., ‘ideophone’ can be represented by IDEO, IDPH, etc. There’s also recent advances in the glossing standards of, for instance, ancient languages, like this paper by DiBiase et al. for Ancient Egyptian; it’s worth a read. (Bonus: check out the article on Kanbun which provides a short intro to how the Japanese marked up Classical Chinese to make sense of it.)\noriginal:         My  s    Marko poexa-l-i avtobus-om v   Peredelkino. \nmorphemes:        1PL COM  Marko go-PST-PL bus-INS    ALL Peredelkino\nfree translation: 'Marko and I went to Perdelkino by bus.'\n\n\nYami\nYesterday, my partner CJ Young (UCSB), who is working with Yami (Tao) data and has been pushed somewhat aggresively by me to adopt R and Rmarkdown gradually easing into the R ecoverse, raised an interesting question: how can I turn my fieldwork glosses into a corpus that’s easily searchable? Just to clarify things, in his fieldwork he’s following a format that rests on splitting recordings into intonation units with the goal of depositing data in the Corpus of Formosan Languages. However, the data is not in that corpus yet, and mostly written down in .pages (the word of mac os). The usage of .pages is not a requirement, but just a consequence of him working together with Greg Vondiziano (UH) and their both having macbooks ha.\nA typical gloss looks like this:\n1.\nko       ononongan  a    kavavatanen            ya        am, \nko       ononong-an a    ka-va~vata-nen         ya        am \n1SG.GEN  narrate-LV LK   NMZ-RDPL~hearsay-PV    DEM.PROX  TOP \n1SG.屬格 述說-處焦  繫詞 名物化-重疊～據說-受焦 指示.近距 主題 \n\nko       nimacita             do\nko       ni-ma-cita           do\n1SG.GEN  PFV-PV.able-see      LOC\n1SG.屬格 完成貌-受焦.能力-看  處格\n\n2.\npaciracirayin an\npa-cira~ciray-in an\nCAU-RDPL~light-PV FP\n使役-重疊～照亮-受焦 語助詞\n\n#e The story I’m going to tell is what I saw in a movie\n#c 我要說的故事是，我在電影上看到的\n#n paciracirayin = 電影; ciray = 亮; cirayin = 照\nSo first there is the gloss number, followed by the original sentence, then an extra level containing the underlying form, then the morphemic glosses in English, in Chinese, and then a free translation of a considerable translation in English (#e) as well as Chinese (#c), and possibly some notes (#n). You can see that there is some structure in the order of these items. But there are also a few annoying things: the first intonation unit has a very long line, which has been split in two (starting with ko); and the translations in #e and #c are metioned for intonation unit 2, but actually also relate to intonation unit 1.\nIdeally, corpora become more machine-searchable if they are further standardized. So, I tried to put my head to it and this is what I came up (taking full inspiration from the ASBC corpus used in my PhD dissertation):\n\n.txt source files (because lightweight and cross-platform)\nscript to turn them into dataframe, enabling the powerfull search functions of R (or python)\n\nSo the goal is to transform the previous into a table with the following columns:\n\nintonation unit number *surface\nunderlying\nenglish morphemes\nchinese morphemes\nenglish translation\nchinese trans\nnotes\n\n\n\nPreprocessing\nAs always, I started out with making a github repository, to detail the different steps. Next I thought about we were going to get from the source text in .pages to .txt to dataframe. In the preprocessing stages, there are about five things that needed to be checked (manually, just to make sure).\n\nCopy into a txt document. Yes, this is easy.\nReplace  with . In a text editor like Atom or even the general text editor on your computer, you can generally replace \\t (tab) with \\s (space) if regular expressions are enabled.\nCheck all multi line glosses on one line. This needs to be checked manually, just to make sure.\nAdd the following. You need to tag the lines, they can be in different orders (maybe one document has the Chinese line before the English line), but they need to be identified. Ideally this can be done programmatically, but better safe with manual than sorry with computational.\n\n‘s’ to surface line\n‘u’ to underlying line\n‘e’ to English gloss\n‘z’ to Chinese gloss\n\nReplace all \\n\\n+ with \\n. This regular expression will delete empty lines.\n\nShould people be reading this and have tips on to make this more efficient, always welcome.\nUPDATE After thinking about it for a while, adding the SUEZ (strategic acronym for the tagging system), the following regular expressions should do the trick.\n(\\d\\.\\n)      replace by `$1s ` (s followed by space) # S\n(^s [^\\n]+\\n) replace by `$1u ` (u followed by space) # U\n(^u [^\\n]+\\n) replace by `$1e ` (e followed by space) # E\n(^e [^\\n]+\\n) replace by `$1z ` (z followed by space) # Z\n\n\nFrom source txt to dataframe\nFor this you need the following packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # collection of tools\nlibrary(here) # best practice project management\nlibrary(fs) # optional here but preparing for many docs later\nlibrary(glue) # will need later\nNext read in the source text that is somewhere in your R project. Learn the here package if you don’t know how that works.\nreadin &lt;- read_lines(here(\"SOURCETEXT.txt\"))\nWhat you get is a vector, called readin, containing every line as a piece of data, something like this:\n[1] 1.\n[2] s ko ononongan a kavavatanen ya am, ko nimacita do\n[3] u ko ononong-an a ka-va~vata-nen ya am ko ni-ma-cita do\n[4] e 1SG.GEN narrate-LV LK NMZ-RDPL~hearsay-PV DEM.PROX TOP 1SG.GEN PFV-PV.able-see LOC\n[5] z 1SG.屬格 述說-處焦 繫詞 名物化-重疊～據說-受焦 指示.近距 主題 1SG.屬格 完成貌-受焦.能力-看 處格\nNext, we need to transform this into the aforementioned table format.\ntableform &lt;- # declaring the output variable\nreadin %&gt;% # take readin and then\n  as_tibble() %&gt;%  # turn it into a fance tibble\n  \n  # tagging (making columns)\n  mutate(linenumber = cumsum(str_detect(value, \"\\\\d\\\\.\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate(category = str_extract(value, \"^..?(?=\\\\s)\")) %&gt;% \n  \n  # spreding wider\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"category\", values_from = \"value\") %&gt;%\n  \n  # fill out the missing translations\n  fill(`#e`, .direction = \"up\") %&gt;% \n  fill(`#c`, .direction = \"up\") %&gt;% \n  \n  # beautify\n  select(-`NA`) %&gt;% \n  rename(surface = s,\n         underlying = u,\n         englishgloss = e,\n         chinesegloss = z,\n         englishtrans = `#e`,\n         chinesetrans = `#c`) %&gt;% \n         \n  # delete the tags 's' 'u' 'e' 'z' as well as #n #c #e\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), \n                ~str_remove(.x, \"^..?\\\\s\")))\nAnd tadaah, the table for this text is ready and can be queried.\n\n\nFinding, furthering and outputting\nLet’s say, you want to find all OBL markers, to see if there is any variation. A simple search can be done with dplyr::filter and str_detect.\ntableform %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(englishgloss, \"OBL\"))\nOr you can select a number of columns of interest and integrate it with a tidytext::unnest_tokens pipeline (or cast to other corpus packages), for instance, if you want to make a dictionary of a certain kind (which can then be used to pretag new texts for which you have the surface form or underlying form).\nFor exploratory output, I would suggest to use the glue package, as it is extremely customisable. Two immediate output formats that come to mind are 1) something closer to what it originally was in .pages, 2) output to be used in the fantastic LaTeX package expex.\nThe syntax of glue is extremely simple. The following will take everything you have and output it in (here in Rmarkdown) in nice text lines. What then needs to happen when you copy to other programs, is to beautify it, and split long lines again on multiple lines.\nglue('{tableform$linenumber}\n     {tableform$surface}\n     {tableform$underlying}\n     {tableform$englishgloss}\n     {tableform$chinesegloss}\n     {tableform$englishtrans}\n     {tableform$chinesetrans}\n     \n     ')\nBut if you’re writing in Rmarkdown or LaTeX, you can easily customize this in such a way that it preformats into the expex format (without having to worry about the multiline glosses or spacing because that’s what expex does!):\nglue('\\ex[glstyle=wrap]\n     \\begingl\n     \\gla {tableform$surface} //\n     \\glb {tableform$underlying} //\n     \\glc {tableform$englishgloss} //\n     \\glft {tableform$englishtrans} //\n     \\endgl\n     \\xe')\n\n\nBenefits\nThe general benefits of having this set up is easy exploration of your data; no longer do you need to open up each .pages document and manually count how many times a certain thing occurs. What is also good is that it keeps reference numbers, so you can always go back to the source. It is a flexible setup, in that if you have a special tag format, for instance a #j for Japanese translation or so, this will automatically be capture in the table. And if you are used to marking the voice system with a V instead of F for focus, then you can implement that easily in R.\nWhat does still need to happen, however, is a metadata file that links the source texts to data on the speaker, but that is just good housekeeping. So probably not the last update on this miniproject, but a good start. Good luck CJ!\n\n\nAddendum\nAfter posting about this blog update on facebook, Shu-Kai Hsieh pointed me into the direction of Yongfu Liao’s app version for when they did fieldwork last year, which can be found here. It’s a beautiful app, and it basically starts from a similar position as this project. It shows very clearly when there are differing glosses, allowing the annotator to standardize the glosses. It also goes beyond my approach by doing the exact dictionary style matching between forms and gloss I mentioned before, which I would implement with tidytext, and it provides a nice quick and dirty look up possibility, shown here when looking for ‘OBL’ (oblique).\n\nThe points I have some reservations about, however, are (1) that the log shows that there are incongruencies between the different columns. (2) The input format (shown below) requires that the glosses are aligned, but I think that is epiphenomenal – one space is all I would want. (3) Fundamentally, while this app is beautiful and useful if you have only a bit of data, it does not enable the user to quickly count a given phenomenon, e.g., the frequency of OBL. And this was the kind of question that CJ asked me. So I think there is room for growth in Yongfu’s app, but also inspiration for the way I approached it.\n[編號].\n[族語轉寫 (原始, optional)]\n[空行 (optional)]\n[族語分析 (aligned)]\n[英文Glossing (aligned)]\n[中文Glossing (aligned)]\n[空行]\n#e [英文翻譯]\n#c [中文翻譯]\n#n [註釋]\n[空行]"

    "text": "Okay, I get that table stuff, what next?\nLet’s say you were able to get the frequencies from a corpus – I should probably mention that, *cough* *cough* not everybody agrees with this kind of contingency tables, the overview paper by Gries (2019) has plenty of interesting references and exciting rebuttals – and you have this table, possibly for lots of elements and/or constructions.\nWe’ll keep an example here that I calculated with Gries’s (2016) book mentioned above. One of the case studies looks at verbs that co-occur with the modal verb must, e.g. must accept, must agree, must confess, vs. how much these verbs occur with other modal verbs, e.g should accept, should agree etc. So in this case, element 1 was a verb (confess) and element 2 was must; not-element-1 were all the other verbs, and not-element-2 were all the other modal verbs.\nThe respective table from an abstract level looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmust\nnot must\nSum\n\n\n\n\nconfess\na\nb\na + b\n\n\nnot confess\nc\nd\nc + d\n\n\nSum\na + c\nb + d\na + b + c + d\n\n\n\nI got these frequencies from the BNC (as Gries shows in his book, but I used my tidyverse skillsTM to get them, so if they are slightly off, then it was because of not following his script completely):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmust\nnot must\nSum\n\n\n\n\nconfess\n11\n1\n12\n\n\nnot confess\n1990\n62114\n64104\n\n\nSum\n2001\n62115\n64116\n\n\n\nOr in a Base R table:\n\na &lt;- 11\nb &lt;- 1\nc &lt;- 1990\nd &lt;- 62114\n\nconfess &lt;- c(a, b)\nnotconfess &lt;- c(c, d)\n\nmust.table &lt;- rbind(confess, notconfess) \ncolnames(must.table) &lt;- c(\"must\", \"notmust\")\nmust.table\n\n           must notmust\nconfess      11       1\nnotconfess 1990   62114\n\n\nWhat do you do now?\nNow it’s time for letter math!\nThe association measure (read: statistical test) that Gries & Stefanowitsch, as well as others, have used most is the Fisher Yates Exact test, and more precisely the negative \\(log10\\) of its \\(p\\)-value. Underlying this (see the link in this paragraph) are calculations using those letter cells (a,b,c,d). Luckily we don’t need to do that manually because R has a function for this – fischer.test():\n\nfisher.test(must.table)\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  must.table\np-value = 3.106e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1\n95 percent confidence interval:\n    49.90447 13241.49567\nsample estimates:\nodds ratio \n  344.6593 \n\n\nSo as you can see the pvalue is 3.1056007^{-16}. If we take the negative \\(log10\\) of this, it becomes 15.5078544, which gives us the result we expected.\nAn easier way of computing the Fisher Yates Exact test of this table is by using the letter math and the pv.Fischer.collostr function provided by Levshina’s Rling package:\n\nRling::pv.Fisher.collostr(a, b, c, d)\n\n[1] 3.105601e-16\n\n\nOther tests that have been proposed are so-called Reliance and Attraction (cf. Schmid & Küchenhoff 2013 a.o.). Reliance is the relative frequency of a verb (confess) with must with regard to all uses of the given verb; Attraction is the relative frequency of a verb (confess) with must based on all usages with must.\n\\[ Reliance = \\frac{a}{a+b}\\]\n\\[ Attraction = \\frac{a}{a+c} \\]\n\nattraction &lt;- a / (a+c) * 100\nreliance &lt;- a / (a+b) * 100\n\nThe Attraction of confess and must is 0.5497251 and the Reliance is 91.6666667. This high Reliance means that whenever confess occurs in the corpus after a modal it relies on must to occur. Its Attraction, however, has a much lower value: must does not necessarily occur with confess, in fact, it occurs with lots of other verbs as well!\nThe third group of tests is actually correlated to Attraction and Reliance: respectively \\(\\Delta P_{word \\to construction}\\) and \\(\\Delta P_{construction \\to word}\\) (cf. Ellis & Ferreira-Junior a.o.). They are also known as tests of cue validity and are calculated as follows:\n\\[\\Delta P_{word \\to construction} = cue_{construction} = \\frac{a}{a + c} - \\frac{b}{b + d}\\]\n\\[\\Delta P_{construction \\to word} = cue_{verb} = \\frac{a}{a + b} - \\frac{c}{c + d}\\]\n\ndP.cueCx &lt;- a/(a + c) - b/(b + d)\ndP.cueVerb &lt;- a/(a + b) - c/(c + d)\n\nSo the \\(\\Delta P_{word \\to construction}\\) of must confess is 0.0054812 and the \\(\\Delta P_{construction \\to word}\\) of must confess is 0.8856234, so these numbers look a lot like those of Attraction and Reliance.\nAnyway, I think you get the drift: if you have the contingency table, you choose an association measure (there are more than these three sets) and analyze the results."

    "text": "From tidy to contingency\nAnyway, while for most summary statistics a tidy format (see hoop 1) is the easiest to work with, I don’t think it’s very intuitive for the association measures paradigm.\nSo in this working example of must + V_inf_ construction what I did was get all the occurrences of all modal verbs + verbs in the infinitive from the BNC corpus. The second step I did was add a column with dplyr::case_when to identify if a modal verb was must or another modal verb.\nLet’s look at this data shall we:\n\ndf.must\n\n# A tibble: 64,116 × 3\n   modal  verb      mod.type\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 can    find      OTHER   \n 2 should stop      OTHER   \n 3 should recognise OTHER   \n 4 will   cost      OTHER   \n 5 might  think     OTHER   \n 6 can    sink      OTHER   \n 7 can    change    OTHER   \n 8 must   help      MUST    \n 9 ll     help      OTHER   \n10 ll     take      OTHER   \n# ℹ 64,106 more rows\n\n\nAs you can see there are 64116 rows, and the table is just a count away form being tidy.\n\ntidy.df.must &lt;- df.must %&gt;%\n  count(mod.type, verb, sort = TRUE)\ntidy.df.must\n\n# A tibble: 2,522 × 3\n   mod.type verb      n\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 OTHER    get    3750\n 2 OTHER    go     3421\n 3 OTHER    see    2409\n 4 OTHER    take   2056\n 5 OTHER    like   1778\n 6 OTHER    say    1647\n 7 OTHER    come   1460\n 8 OTHER    make   1383\n 9 OTHER    give   1245\n10 OTHER    put    1162\n# ℹ 2,512 more rows\n\n\nMuch ‘prettier’, but what next? This is actually the mental step I struggled the most with, this dissonance between tidy and contingency. However, since we coded mod.type with a binary value: “OTHER” or “MUST”, it is actually trivial to dplyr::spread or dplyr::pivot_wider them to a “tidy contingency table”:\n\nspread.tidy.df.must &lt;- tidy.df.must %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(values_from = n,\n              names_from = mod.type) \nspread.tidy.df.must\n\n# A tibble: 2,113 × 3\n   verb  OTHER  MUST\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 get    3750   102\n 2 go     3421    94\n 3 see    2409    14\n 4 take   2056    63\n 5 like   1778     3\n 6 say    1647   105\n 7 come   1460    41\n 8 make   1383    62\n 9 give   1245    22\n10 put    1162    18\n# ℹ 2,103 more rows\n\n\nHey, this looks a lot like those schematic tables we had at the beginning! But now the real challenge is to turn these numbers into the letters a, b, c, and d, so we can perform our letter math.\nAfter changing all numeric values we have to doubles (instead of integers) and changing all NAs to 0, we can get the letters by following simple arithmetic from our original schematic table, e.g. if we know a and a+c, then c = a+c - a etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement 2\nNot element 2 / other elements\nSum\n\n\n\n\nElement 1 \na\nb\na + b\n\n\nNot element 1 / other elements\nc\nd\nc + d\n\n\nSum\na + c\nb + d\na + b + c + d\n\n\n\n\nspread.tidy.df.must %&gt;%\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ as.double(.x)) %&gt;% # we'll want doubles instead of integers\n  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ replace_na(.x, 0)) %&gt;% # NAs should be 0\n  \n  mutate(a = MUST,\n       ac = sum(MUST),\n       c = ac - a,\n       ab = MUST + OTHER,\n       b = ab - a,\n       abcd = sum(MUST, OTHER),\n       d = abcd - a - b -c,\n       aExp = (a + b)*(a + c)/(a + b + c + d)) -&gt; abcd.must\nabcd.must\n\n# A tibble: 2,113 × 11\n   verb  OTHER  MUST     a    ac     c    ab     b  abcd     d  aExp\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 get    3750   102   102  2001  1899  3852  3750 64116 58365 120. \n 2 go     3421    94    94  2001  1907  3515  3421 64116 58694 110. \n 3 see    2409    14    14  2001  1987  2423  2409 64116 59706  75.6\n 4 take   2056    63    63  2001  1938  2119  2056 64116 60059  66.1\n 5 like   1778     3     3  2001  1998  1781  1778 64116 60337  55.6\n 6 say    1647   105   105  2001  1896  1752  1647 64116 60468  54.7\n 7 come   1460    41    41  2001  1960  1501  1460 64116 60655  46.8\n 8 make   1383    62    62  2001  1939  1445  1383 64116 60732  45.1\n 9 give   1245    22    22  2001  1979  1267  1245 64116 60870  39.5\n10 put    1162    18    18  2001  1983  1180  1162 64116 60953  36.8\n# ℹ 2,103 more rows\n\n\nSo now we can easily perform all of the association measures we want, and rank them accordingly."

    "text": "tl; dr\nI show why it is worthwile to put my Chinese-related datasets in packages and how I went about it.\n\n\nIntroduction\nI don’t know if I’m very late to the party, but in this final sprint towards a finished dissertation, I keep finding myself juggling multiple datasets when using them in R. This usually is paired with a readr::read_csv() or related functions, but the drawback is that I have to go find where I actually put that dataset on my computer. This causes me some friction (even though the location didn’t change), but what’s worse is that that’s actually not reproducible. In other words, the code I wrote that way is not portable.\n\n\nFirst trial: CHIDEOD\nAt some point during this year, I suddenly remembered some blog posts I had read like a year ago, on how to turn your dataset into an R package*. My first experiment was the database I’m making myself, the Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD; available here). Somewhere in March/April this year I managed to turn that into a data package, and have done so with subesquent versions of CHIDEOD. It provided me with the functionality of just running a library(CHIDEOD) and BAM!, there was the chideod object to my disposal.\n*More precisely the blog posts I read were:\n\nEd Hagen’s “Put your data into an R package”\nDave Kleinschmidt’s “Taking your data to go with R packages”\nErick Howard’s “How to create an R data package”\nHilary Parker’s “Writing an R package from scratch”\n\n\n\nOther datasets\nThen somewhere in the beginning of this semester something clicked: I would take the other datasets I’m often working with, and find a way to turn them into data packages as well. In concreto, those datasets are\n\nBaxter and Sagart’s Middle Chinese and Old Chinese reconstructions. This was all the more important, because this website has been unavailble at times (maybe because there is no https certificate?, I don’t know)\nSun et al.’s Chinese Lexical Database, a very good database for psycholinguistic information on simplified Chinese characters.\nThe Hànyǔ dà cídiǎn 漢語大詞典, a giant monolingual dictionary of Chinese.\nThe Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Chinese ASBC 4.0.\n\nNow, I need to mention that for my own purposes, I have made some alterations to all of these datasets.\n\nFor Baxter & Sagart’s dataset, I’ve added things like an IPA version of the Middle Chinese (thanks to sinopy), a simplified column next to the traditional character one etc.\nFor the Chinese Lexical Database, which is based on simplified characters, I found it useful to still add a traditional column and pull the characters of each word into traditional characters as well. Most of the psycholinguistic measures (entropy, reaction time etc.) are only valid for the simplified ones, but there is still a wealth of information that is useful for the traditional ones.\nI’ve tidied up the Hànyǔ dà cídiǎn 漢語大詞典, by splitting all the meanings that were numbered per lemma.\nI was lucky to access an institutional version of the ASBC 4.0 but it was unfortunately coded in the programming-language-neutral XML, which is not fun to use (“XML IS HELL”). So I spent like a day turning it into nicely structured .Rds files. Not language-neutral (R-friendly) but easier to use for me. I also changed the spacing of the “Chines big space” (the one that is one square long and tall) to normal spacing; on top of the ugly tagging method of using brackets, e.g. 我(PRON), to less visually cluttered underscores, i.e. 我_PRON.\n\n\n\n\nStoring them somewhere\nIn an ideal scenario I would do this step first, but I actually did the package stuff (see next section) first. In this step I uploaded my datasets to a (private) repository. Since my experience with the Open Science Framework OSF had been positive, I decided to dump my datasets there. This has the advantages that I can 1) version them, 2) access them from different devices (in case of computer crashes or changes etc.). So now I need to find out how to shareable these new datasets are. I’m pretty sure I can’t just make public the dictionary (even though I have transformed it), or the corpus – although I think that these projects should be freely available. The dataset by Baxter & Sagart and the Chinese Lexical Database should be a bit more available, but I will contact the authors shortly about these issues and when they are available, set the packages repositories on gitub to public, so you can all enjoy them.\n\n\nHow to make a datapackage\nThe main tool I used to create these datapackages is the DataPackageR package. This post on the ROpenSci blog explains pretty well the why and how, and I actually just used the “copy + adapt no jutsu” to make my packages. It does warrant a basic know-how of R(studio) and github, so if you need to brush up on those skills, I can recommend Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, a.k.a. Happy git with R.\nSo that’s what I did with most of the packages. To see the one that is already public – my CHIDEOD – you can go to this page.\nAnd to download it, you should be able to do these functions\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"simazhi/chinese_ideophone_database/CHIDEOD\")\nIf you find any problems with this functionality, please contact me!\n\n\nChallenges\nI don’t know how to make the data package for the large-ish dataset of the Hànyǔ dà cídiǎn 漢語大詞典 (some 200 MB), since it is bigger than Github’s size allowance. I just found this blog on attaching larger datasets, so I’m gonna check that out at some point. Also the ASBC corpus, I have just stored in the repository, it’s probably safer there.\nAnother challenge is naming the packages. I’ve settled for:\n\nCHIDEOD\nCLD\nbaxteRsagaRt\n(future: HYDCD)\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAfter updating to a new version of R (I read that R 4.0 is around the corner), and / or updating to a newer version of Rstudio, the dance of reinstalling previously installed packages will befall us once again. But knowing that this includes (re)installing these datasets I made and that I often use, gives me some solace, because I (will?) have looked ahead to that moment and can just do a simple install_github and a library(PACKAGE) and badabing badaboom: I can run my scripts, in the now and in the future.\nIf the aforementioned parties are okay with it, I will make my github data packages public and share them in this post, so keep an eye out for that yo!"

    "text": "Glossing\nGlossing is part and parcel in linguistics. Part of our training is learning to represent linguistic data in a format that can be understood by all. An example can be found in below, taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules. In general, morphemes should correspond, being marked by a hyphen or space to separate them, depending on boundedness. The details are highly dependent on your subfield and your audience. For instance, ‘1PL’ (first plural pronoun) could also be represented by ‘we’ in certain contexts. On other occasions, categories of the language you’re studying are not included in the standard Leipzig Glossing Rules set, e.g., ‘ideophone’ can be represented by IDEO, IDPH, etc. There’s also recent advances in the glossing standards of, for instance, ancient languages, like this paper by DiBiase et al. for Ancient Egyptian; it’s worth a read. (Bonus: check out the article on Kanbun which provides a short intro to how the Japanese marked up Classical Chinese to make sense of it.)\noriginal:         My  s    Marko poexa-l-i avtobus-om v   Peredelkino. \nmorphemes:        1PL COM  Marko go-PST-PL bus-INS    ALL Peredelkino\nfree translation: 'Marko and I went to Perdelkino by bus.'\n\n\nYami\nYesterday, my partner CJ Young (UCSB), who is working with Yami (Tao) data and has been pushed somewhat aggresively by me to adopt R and Rmarkdown gradually easing into the R ecoverse, raised an interesting question: how can I turn my fieldwork glosses into a corpus that’s easily searchable? Just to clarify things, in his fieldwork he’s following a format that rests on splitting recordings into intonation units with the goal of depositing data in the Corpus of Formosan Languages. However, the data is not in that corpus yet, and mostly written down in .pages (the word of mac os). The usage of .pages is not a requirement, but just a consequence of him working together with Greg Vondiziano (UH) and their both having macbooks ha.\nA typical gloss looks like this:\n1.\nko       ononongan  a    kavavatanen            ya        am, \nko       ononong-an a    ka-va~vata-nen         ya        am \n1SG.GEN  narrate-LV LK   NMZ-RDPL~hearsay-PV    DEM.PROX  TOP \n1SG.屬格 述說-處焦  繫詞 名物化-重疊～據說-受焦 指示.近距 主題 \n\nko       nimacita             do\nko       ni-ma-cita           do\n1SG.GEN  PFV-PV.able-see      LOC\n1SG.屬格 完成貌-受焦.能力-看  處格\n\n2.\npaciracirayin an\npa-cira~ciray-in an\nCAU-RDPL~light-PV FP\n使役-重疊～照亮-受焦 語助詞\n\n#e The story I’m going to tell is what I saw in a movie\n#c 我要說的故事是，我在電影上看到的\n#n paciracirayin = 電影; ciray = 亮; cirayin = 照\nSo first there is the gloss number, followed by the original sentence, then an extra level containing the underlying form, then the morphemic glosses in English, in Chinese, and then a free translation of a considerable translation in English (#e) as well as Chinese (#c), and possibly some notes (#n). You can see that there is some structure in the order of these items. But there are also a few annoying things: the first intonation unit has a very long line, which has been split in two (starting with ko); and the translations in #e and #c are metioned for intonation unit 2, but actually also relate to intonation unit 1.\nIdeally, corpora become more machine-searchable if they are further standardized. So, I tried to put my head to it and this is what I came up (taking full inspiration from the ASBC corpus used in my PhD dissertation):\n\n.txt source files (because lightweight and cross-platform)\nscript to turn them into dataframe, enabling the powerfull search functions of R (or python)\n\nSo the goal is to transform the previous into a table with the following columns:\n\nintonation unit number *surface\nunderlying\nenglish morphemes\nchinese morphemes\nenglish translation\nchinese trans\nnotes\n\n\n\nPreprocessing\nAs always, I started out with making a github repository, to detail the different steps. Next I thought about we were going to get from the source text in .pages to .txt to dataframe. In the preprocessing stages, there are about five things that needed to be checked (manually, just to make sure).\n\nCopy into a txt document. Yes, this is easy.\nReplace  with . In a text editor like Atom or even the general text editor on your computer, you can generally replace \\t (tab) with \\s (space) if regular expressions are enabled.\nCheck all multi line glosses on one line. This needs to be checked manually, just to make sure.\nAdd the following. You need to tag the lines, they can be in different orders (maybe one document has the Chinese line before the English line), but they need to be identified. Ideally this can be done programmatically, but better safe with manual than sorry with computational.\n\n‘s’ to surface line\n‘u’ to underlying line\n‘e’ to English gloss\n‘z’ to Chinese gloss\n\nReplace all \\n\\n+ with \\n. This regular expression will delete empty lines.\n\nShould people be reading this and have tips on to make this more efficient, always welcome.\nUPDATE After thinking about it for a while, adding the SUEZ (strategic acronym for the tagging system), the following regular expressions should do the trick.\n(\\d\\.\\n)      replace by `$1s ` (s followed by space) # S\n(^s [^\\n]+\\n) replace by `$1u ` (u followed by space) # U\n(^u [^\\n]+\\n) replace by `$1e ` (e followed by space) # E\n(^e [^\\n]+\\n) replace by `$1z ` (z followed by space) # Z\n\n\nFrom source txt to dataframe\nFor this you need the following packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # collection of tools\nlibrary(here) # best practice project management\nlibrary(fs) # optional here but preparing for many docs later\nlibrary(glue) # will need later\nNext read in the source text that is somewhere in your R project. Learn the here package if you don’t know how that works.\nreadin &lt;- read_lines(here(\"SOURCETEXT.txt\"))\nWhat you get is a vector, called readin, containing every line as a piece of data, something like this:\n[1] 1.\n[2] s ko ononongan a kavavatanen ya am, ko nimacita do\n[3] u ko ononong-an a ka-va~vata-nen ya am ko ni-ma-cita do\n[4] e 1SG.GEN narrate-LV LK NMZ-RDPL~hearsay-PV DEM.PROX TOP 1SG.GEN PFV-PV.able-see LOC\n[5] z 1SG.屬格 述說-處焦 繫詞 名物化-重疊～據說-受焦 指示.近距 主題 1SG.屬格 完成貌-受焦.能力-看 處格\nNext, we need to transform this into the aforementioned table format.\ntableform &lt;- # declaring the output variable\nreadin %&gt;% # take readin and then\n  as_tibble() %&gt;%  # turn it into a fance tibble\n  \n  # tagging (making columns)\n  mutate(linenumber = cumsum(str_detect(value, \"\\\\d\\\\.\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate(category = str_extract(value, \"^..?(?=\\\\s)\")) %&gt;% \n  \n  # spreding wider\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"category\", values_from = \"value\") %&gt;%\n  \n  # fill out the missing translations\n  fill(`#e`, .direction = \"up\") %&gt;% \n  fill(`#c`, .direction = \"up\") %&gt;% \n  \n  # beautify\n  select(-`NA`) %&gt;% \n  rename(surface = s,\n         underlying = u,\n         englishgloss = e,\n         chinesegloss = z,\n         englishtrans = `#e`,\n         chinesetrans = `#c`) %&gt;% \n         \n  # delete the tags 's' 'u' 'e' 'z' as well as #n #c #e\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), \n                ~str_remove(.x, \"^..?\\\\s\")))\nAnd tadaah, the table for this text is ready and can be queried.\n\n\nFinding, furthering and outputting\nLet’s say, you want to find all OBL markers, to see if there is any variation. A simple search can be done with dplyr::filter and str_detect.\ntableform %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(englishgloss, \"OBL\"))\nOr you can select a number of columns of interest and integrate it with a tidytext::unnest_tokens pipeline (or cast to other corpus packages), for instance, if you want to make a dictionary of a certain kind (which can then be used to pretag new texts for which you have the surface form or underlying form).\nFor exploratory output, I would suggest to use the glue package, as it is extremely customisable. Two immediate output formats that come to mind are 1) something closer to what it originally was in .pages, 2) output to be used in the fantastic LaTeX package expex.\nThe syntax of glue is extremely simple. The following will take everything you have and output it in (here in Rmarkdown) in nice text lines. What then needs to happen when you copy to other programs, is to beautify it, and split long lines again on multiple lines.\nglue('{tableform$linenumber}\n     {tableform$surface}\n     {tableform$underlying}\n     {tableform$englishgloss}\n     {tableform$chinesegloss}\n     {tableform$englishtrans}\n     {tableform$chinesetrans}\n     \n     ')\nBut if you’re writing in Rmarkdown or LaTeX, you can easily customize this in such a way that it preformats into the expex format (without having to worry about the multiline glosses or spacing because that’s what expex does!):\nglue('\\ex[glstyle=wrap]\n     \\begingl\n     \\gla {tableform$surface} //\n     \\glb {tableform$underlying} //\n     \\glc {tableform$englishgloss} //\n     \\glft {tableform$englishtrans} //\n     \\endgl\n     \\xe')\n\n\nBenefits\nThe general benefits of having this set up is easy exploration of your data; no longer do you need to open up each .pages document and manually count how many times a certain thing occurs. What is also good is that it keeps reference numbers, so you can always go back to the source. It is a flexible setup, in that if you have a special tag format, for instance a #j for Japanese translation or so, this will automatically be capture in the table. And if you are used to marking the voice system with a V instead of F for focus, then you can implement that easily in R.\nWhat does still need to happen, however, is a metadata file that links the source texts to data on the speaker, but that is just good housekeeping. So probably not the last update on this miniproject, but a good start. Good luck CJ!\n\n\nAddendum\nAfter posting about this blog update on facebook, Shu-Kai Hsieh pointed me into the direction of Yongfu Liao’s app version for when they did fieldwork last year, which can be found here. It’s a beautiful app, and it basically starts from a similar position as this project. It shows very clearly when there are differing glosses, allowing the annotator to standardize the glosses. It also goes beyond my approach by doing the exact dictionary style matching between forms and gloss I mentioned before, which I would implement with tidytext, and it provides a nice quick and dirty look up possibility, shown here when looking for ‘OBL’ (oblique).\n\nThe points I have some reservations about, however, are (1) that the log shows that there are incongruencies between the different columns. (2) The input format (shown below) requires that the glosses are aligned, but I think that is epiphenomenal – one space is all I would want. (3) Fundamentally, while this app is beautiful and useful if you have only a bit of data, it does not enable the user to quickly count a given phenomenon, e.g., the frequency of OBL. And this was the kind of question that CJ asked me. So I think there is room for growth in Yongfu’s app, but also inspiration for the way I approached it.\n[編號].\n[族語轉寫 (原始, optional)]\n[空行 (optional)]\n[族語分析 (aligned)]\n[英文Glossing (aligned)]\n[中文Glossing (aligned)]\n[空行]\n#e [英文翻譯]\n#c [中文翻譯]\n#n [註釋]\n[空行]"

    "text": "Okay, I get that table stuff, what next?\nLet’s say you were able to get the frequencies from a corpus – I should probably mention that, *cough* *cough* not everybody agrees with this kind of contingency tables, the overview paper by Gries (2019) has plenty of interesting references and exciting rebuttals – and you have this table, possibly for lots of elements and/or constructions.\nWe’ll keep an example here that I calculated with Gries’s (2016) book mentioned above. One of the case studies looks at verbs that co-occur with the modal verb must, e.g. must accept, must agree, must confess, vs. how much these verbs occur with other modal verbs, e.g should accept, should agree etc. So in this case, element 1 was a verb (confess) and element 2 was must; not-element-1 were all the other verbs, and not-element-2 were all the other modal verbs.\nThe respective table from an abstract level looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmust\nnot must\nSum\n\n\n\n\nconfess\na\nb\na + b\n\n\nnot confess\nc\nd\nc + d\n\n\nSum\na + c\nb + d\na + b + c + d\n\n\n\nI got these frequencies from the BNC (as Gries shows in his book, but I used my tidyverse skillsTM to get them, so if they are slightly off, then it was because of not following his script completely):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmust\nnot must\nSum\n\n\n\n\nconfess\n11\n1\n12\n\n\nnot confess\n1990\n62114\n64104\n\n\nSum\n2001\n62115\n64116\n\n\n\nOr in a Base R table:\n\na &lt;- 11\nb &lt;- 1\nc &lt;- 1990\nd &lt;- 62114\n\nconfess &lt;- c(a, b)\nnotconfess &lt;- c(c, d)\n\nmust.table &lt;- rbind(confess, notconfess) \ncolnames(must.table) &lt;- c(\"must\", \"notmust\")\nmust.table\n\n           must notmust\nconfess      11       1\nnotconfess 1990   62114\n\n\nWhat do you do now?\nNow it’s time for letter math!\nThe association measure (read: statistical test) that Gries & Stefanowitsch, as well as others, have used most is the Fisher Yates Exact test, and more precisely the negative \\(log10\\) of its \\(p\\)-value. Underlying this (see the link in this paragraph) are calculations using those letter cells (a,b,c,d). Luckily we don’t need to do that manually because R has a function for this – fischer.test():\n\nfisher.test(must.table)\n\n\n    Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  must.table\np-value = 3.106e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1\n95 percent confidence interval:\n    49.90447 13241.49567\nsample estimates:\nodds ratio \n  344.6593 \n\n\nSo as you can see the pvalue is 3.1056007^{-16}. If we take the negative \\(log10\\) of this, it becomes 15.5078544, which gives us the result we expected.\nAn easier way of computing the Fisher Yates Exact test of this table is by using the letter math and the pv.Fischer.collostr function provided by Levshina’s Rling package:\n\nRling::pv.Fisher.collostr(a, b, c, d)\n\n[1] 3.105601e-16\n\n\nOther tests that have been proposed are so-called Reliance and Attraction (cf. Schmid & Küchenhoff 2013 a.o.). Reliance is the relative frequency of a verb (confess) with must with regard to all uses of the given verb; Attraction is the relative frequency of a verb (confess) with must based on all usages with must.\n\\[ Reliance = \\frac{a}{a+b}\\]\n\\[ Attraction = \\frac{a}{a+c} \\]\n\nattraction &lt;- a / (a+c) * 100\nreliance &lt;- a / (a+b) * 100\n\nThe Attraction of confess and must is 0.5497251 and the Reliance is 91.6666667. This high Reliance means that whenever confess occurs in the corpus after a modal it relies on must to occur. Its Attraction, however, has a much lower value: must does not necessarily occur with confess, in fact, it occurs with lots of other verbs as well!\nThe third group of tests is actually correlated to Attraction and Reliance: respectively \\(\\Delta P_{word \\to construction}\\) and \\(\\Delta P_{construction \\to word}\\) (cf. Ellis & Ferreira-Junior a.o.). They are also known as tests of cue validity and are calculated as follows:\n\\[\\Delta P_{word \\to construction} = cue_{construction} = \\frac{a}{a + c} - \\frac{b}{b + d}\\]\n\\[\\Delta P_{construction \\to word} = cue_{verb} = \\frac{a}{a + b} - \\frac{c}{c + d}\\]\n\ndP.cueCx &lt;- a/(a + c) - b/(b + d)\ndP.cueVerb &lt;- a/(a + b) - c/(c + d)\n\nSo the \\(\\Delta P_{word \\to construction}\\) of must confess is 0.0054812 and the \\(\\Delta P_{construction \\to word}\\) of must confess is 0.8856234, so these numbers look a lot like those of Attraction and Reliance.\nAnyway, I think you get the drift: if you have the contingency table, you choose an association measure (there are more than these three sets) and analyze the results."

    "text": "From tidy to contingency\nAnyway, while for most summary statistics a tidy format (see hoop 1) is the easiest to work with, I don’t think it’s very intuitive for the association measures paradigm.\nSo in this working example of must + V_inf_ construction what I did was get all the occurrences of all modal verbs + verbs in the infinitive from the BNC corpus. The second step I did was add a column with dplyr::case_when to identify if a modal verb was must or another modal verb.\nLet’s look at this data shall we:\n\ndf.must\n\n# A tibble: 64,116 × 3\n   modal  verb      mod.type\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 can    find      OTHER   \n 2 should stop      OTHER   \n 3 should recognise OTHER   \n 4 will   cost      OTHER   \n 5 might  think     OTHER   \n 6 can    sink      OTHER   \n 7 can    change    OTHER   \n 8 must   help      MUST    \n 9 ll     help      OTHER   \n10 ll     take      OTHER   \n# ℹ 64,106 more rows\n\n\nAs you can see there are 64116 rows, and the table is just a count away form being tidy.\n\ntidy.df.must &lt;- df.must %&gt;%\n  count(mod.type, verb, sort = TRUE)\ntidy.df.must\n\n# A tibble: 2,522 × 3\n   mod.type verb      n\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 OTHER    get    3750\n 2 OTHER    go     3421\n 3 OTHER    see    2409\n 4 OTHER    take   2056\n 5 OTHER    like   1778\n 6 OTHER    say    1647\n 7 OTHER    come   1460\n 8 OTHER    make   1383\n 9 OTHER    give   1245\n10 OTHER    put    1162\n# ℹ 2,512 more rows\n\n\nMuch ‘prettier’, but what next? This is actually the mental step I struggled the most with, this dissonance between tidy and contingency. However, since we coded mod.type with a binary value: “OTHER” or “MUST”, it is actually trivial to dplyr::spread or dplyr::pivot_wider them to a “tidy contingency table”:\n\nspread.tidy.df.must &lt;- tidy.df.must %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(values_from = n,\n              names_from = mod.type) \nspread.tidy.df.must\n\n# A tibble: 2,113 × 3\n   verb  OTHER  MUST\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 get    3750   102\n 2 go     3421    94\n 3 see    2409    14\n 4 take   2056    63\n 5 like   1778     3\n 6 say    1647   105\n 7 come   1460    41\n 8 make   1383    62\n 9 give   1245    22\n10 put    1162    18\n# ℹ 2,103 more rows\n\n\nHey, this looks a lot like those schematic tables we had at the beginning!

    "text": "tl; dr\nI show why it is worthwile to put my Chinese-related datasets in packages and how I went about it.\n\n\nIntroduction\nI don’t know if I’m very late to the party, but in this final sprint towards a finished dissertation, I keep finding myself juggling multiple datasets when using them in R. This usually is paired with a readr::read_csv() or related functions, but the drawback is that I have to go find where I actually put that dataset on my computer. This causes me some friction (even though the location didn’t change), but what’s worse is that that’s actually not reproducible. In other words, the code I wrote that way is not portable.\n\n\nFirst trial: CHIDEOD\nAt some point during this year, I suddenly remembered some blog posts I had read like a year ago, on how to turn your dataset into an R package*. My first experiment was the database I’m making myself, the Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD; available here). Somewhere in March/April this year I managed to turn that into a data package, and have done so with subesquent versions of CHIDEOD. It provided me with the functionality of just running a library(CHIDEOD) and BAM!, there was the chideod object to my disposal.\n*More precisely the blog posts I read were:\n\nEd Hagen’s “Put your data into an R package”\nDave Kleinschmidt’s “Taking your data to go with R packages”\nErick Howard’s “How to create an R data package”\nHilary Parker’s “Writing an R package from scratch”\n\n\n\nOther datasets\nThen somewhere in the beginning of this semester something clicked: I would take the other datasets I’m often working with, and find a way to turn them into data packages as well. In concreto, those datasets are\n\nBaxter and Sagart’s Middle Chinese and Old Chinese reconstructions. This was all the more important, because this website has been unavailble at times (maybe because there is no https certificate?, I don’t know)\nSun et al.’s Chinese Lexical Database, a very good database for psycholinguistic information on simplified Chinese characters.\nThe Hànyǔ dà cídiǎn 漢語大詞典, a giant monolingual dictionary of Chinese.\nThe Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Chinese ASBC 4.0.\n\nNow, I need to mention that for my own purposes, I have made some alterations to all of these datasets.\n\nFor Baxter & Sagart’s dataset, I’ve added things like an IPA version of the Middle Chinese (thanks to sinopy), a simplified column next to the traditional character one etc.\nFor the Chinese Lexical Database, which is based on simplified characters, I found it useful to still add a traditional column and pull the characters of each word into traditional characters as well. Most of the psycholinguistic measures (entropy, reaction time etc.) are only valid for the simplified ones, but there is still a wealth of information that is useful for the traditional ones.\nI’ve tidied up the Hànyǔ dà cídiǎn 漢語大詞典, by splitting all the meanings that were numbered per lemma.\nI was lucky to access an institutional version of the ASBC 4.0 but it was unfortunately coded in the programming-language-neutral XML, which is not fun to use (“XML IS HELL”). So I spent like a day turning it into nicely structured .Rds files. Not language-neutral (R-friendly) but easier to use for me. I also changed the spacing of the “Chines big space” (the one that is one square long and tall) to normal spacing; on top of the ugly tagging method of using brackets, e.g. 我(PRON), to less visually cluttered underscores, i.e. 我_PRON.\n\n\n\n\nStoring them somewhere\nIn an ideal scenario I would do this step first, but I actually did the package stuff (see next section) first. In this step I uploaded my datasets to a (private) repository. Since my experience with the Open Science Framework OSF had been positive, I decided to dump my datasets there. This has the advantages that I can 1) version them, 2) access them from different devices (in case of computer crashes or changes etc.). So now I need to find out how to shareable these new datasets are. I’m pretty sure I can’t just make public the dictionary (even though I have transformed it), or the corpus – although I think that these projects should be freely available. The dataset by Baxter & Sagart and the Chinese Lexical Database should be a bit more available, but I will contact the authors shortly about these issues and when they are available, set the packages repositories on gitub to public, so you can all enjoy them.\n\n\nHow to make a datapackage\nThe main tool I used to create these datapackages is the DataPackageR package. This post on the ROpenSci blog explains pretty well the why and how, and I actually just used the “copy + adapt no jutsu” to make my packages. It does warrant a basic know-how of R(studio) and github, so if you need to brush up on those skills, I can recommend Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, a.k.a. Happy git with R.\nSo that’s what I did with most of the packages. To see the one that is already public – my CHIDEOD – you can go to this page.\nAnd to download it, you should be able to do these functions\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"simazhi/chinese_ideophone_database/CHIDEOD\")\nIf you find any problems with this functionality, please contact me!\n\n\nChallenges\nI don’t know how to make the data package for the large-ish dataset of the Hànyǔ dà cídiǎn 漢語大詞典 (some 200 MB), since it is bigger than Github’s size allowance. I just found this blog on attaching larger datasets, so I’m gonna check that out at some point. Also the ASBC corpus, I have just stored in the repository, it’s probably safer there.\nAnother challenge is naming the packages. I’ve settled for:\n\nCHIDEOD\nCLD\nbaxteRsagaRt\n(future: HYDCD)\n\n\n\nConclusion\nAfter updating to a new version of R (I read that R 4.0 is around the corner), and / or updating to a newer version of Rstudio, the dance of reinstalling previously installed packages will befall us once again. But knowing that this includes (re)installing these datasets I made and that I often use, gives me some solace, because I (will?) have looked ahead to that moment and can just do a simple install_github and a library(PACKAGE) and badabing badaboom: I can run my scripts, in the now and in the future.\nIf the aforementioned parties are okay with it, I will make my github data packages public and share them in this post, so keep an eye out for that yo!"

    "text": "Hi, reader. Since I am doing research most of the time and somewhat struggling with the question of what I should let out of the bag and on this blog, my findings have still only made their ways to research conferences, some articles, and my notes, instead of ending up on this platform as well. So, as it has turned out to be difficult to keep this blog updated, a catch-up blog is warranted. Last update, published in August, and talking about events until April, was already an attempt to do so. However, with the new year going strong, it’s time to quickly and efficiently share with you some moments that really made my (last) year.\nWhat I envision, then, is a selection of the best moments that were captured on camera, provided with (snarky) comments. After this one blog, I plan to give some more research-related updates as well.\n\nField work on / trip to Orchid Island\nJust like I took my linguistic fieldwork class in my first year here – on Isbukun Bunun, for which I had e-lectures last semester,\n\n\n– last year’s master students had to study one of the aboriginal languages of Taiwan. That year it was Yami, also known as Tao. The Tao people live on Orchid island (Lányǔ 蘭嶼), an island off the coast of Taiwan. See the map for its location:\n\n\nThe Tao speak a language that’s more closely related to Phillippine languages, more precisely the Batanic islands, a small archipelago located south of Orchid island. And even though these languages appear to be mutually intelligible, it is not allowed to enter Taiwan or the Phillippines by just taking a boat to the other island – no, you have to go all the way to an aiport (Taipei? Kaohsiung?) that flies to Manila in the Phillippines, and then take a boat to these Batanic islands. It’s crazy and inefficient.\nAnyway, my first photo is the flying fish (libangbang) that are eaten all over the island. They are caught and hung (hanged? :p) to dry.\n\n\nAs we got closer to the island, it just looked like Jurassic park:\n\n\nAnd then there is the amazing Mantou mountain – which is a holy mountain for the Tao people. We were staying in a bay next to it, and it provided me with a view that will be very hard to forget. So I am grateful for the opportunity of tagging along their fieldwork class, which turned into a fieldtrip for me. Not that I didn’t do anything there – oh no, I was busy revising my article on the conception of ‘weather’ in Chinese, which has since been published. Here’s Manthou mountain:\n\n\n\n\nOh, and here are our professor, Sung Li-May, and CJ and me:\n\n\n\n\nFriends visiting me, me visiting friends (and family)\nI am also grateful for all the friends that have visited me in the last few years (this section is in no particular order). For instance, it is always amazing to see my Spanish amigo Guillermo.\n\n\nOr the feeling of togetherness when all the Belgians gather in support of our Red Devils football team:\n\n\nOr when I meet new friend(-of-a-friend)s, like Andrew here:\n\n\nOr just get to hang out with my regular posse, for instance the Belgian King’s Day event, where they serve fries, beer, chocolates, waffles and everything else that is (claimed to be) Belgian cuisine. (Pls ignore my big eyes.)\n\n\nBut this year I also got to go out quite a bit to visit old friends. For instance, I went to Hong Kong and met up with friends of CJ that have become my friends as well:\n\n\nOr my brilliant colleague-PhD-peer Arthur, who agreed on a trip to my favourite place in Hong Kong – Chi Lin Nunnery.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s where I also had this Indian dinner with my Japanese NTU linguistics colleague Saito. It was a funny dinner because they asked you to become a member of their restaurant before you were allowed to dine there.\n\n\nAnd how could I forget Ian the Korean:\n\n\nAnd when I went to Belgium in May (see section below as to the reason why), I went to have a look at my old high school. Here are some of my favourite teachers from that place, some of which I hadn’t seen in about ten years, but they all remembered me, as I did them.\n\n\nOr the second time I went back in December and met up with some other good friends, like the wonderful Sinology crew:\n\n\nSpecial shout out to Lai Man for letting me stay over and making me more breakfast than we could finish:\n\n\nSo whether it is having tacos in Antwerp with the other 50% of 6LWiGa,\n\n\nor taking a walk in a triangular park with dear friends,\n\n\nor meeting new friends – linguistics style\n\n\nor Christmas style –\n\n\nor old friends while singing karaoke,\n\n\nI am happy to have had their support and friendship throughout last year. And I am not really writing this blog in order to inform them – I think they know. Rather, this is a personal reflection on some stellar moments that really stood out for me in the period April 2018-December 2018.\nA big part of that is my family at home. It was a huge boost to see them twice this year, and to be able to spend Christmas with them – my first one since I came to Taiwan for my PhD. And it’s kind of funny, I always somewhat like the tradition of family gatherings, but didn’t realize I would miss it this much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, that does not take away I have always felt welcome in my department here in Taiwan, which is small enough to be like a family as well. Never does this become clearer than during our annual Christmas party:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo let us join together\n\n\nand raise a glass to keeping in touch. Because I will keep cherishing these moments.\n\n\n\n\nWeddings\nAh, finally I’m really at that age where people I know are tying the knot left and right of me.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Aaaah, can you feel it, radiating from this picture?\n\n\nSpring was in the air. And also the in the title of this update.\nIn this update I’ll write about two main events in my Taiwan life: finding out that I passed the intermediate Isbukun Bunun exam and the visit of my lovely classmates from Sinology, back in the day. Have fun reading!\n\nPassing the Bunun exam\nThose among you who have been avid readers of my blog for a longer time probably know that a few years ago, I got the chance to study one of the indigenous languages of Taiwan. The language we did that year in our fieldwork class was Bunun, and to be more precise the Isbukun dialect.\nIf you are suddenly falling out of the sky, not knowing what in the world I am talking about, I advise you to read this post. And if you are already firm on the ground, you can also read it again, as a friendly reminder.\nAnyway, after that semester, I have also been working on the Bunun part of the Formosan Spoken Language corpus, as I also mentioned here. Well, now the language elicitation is finally coming to an end, and I have had to say temporary goodbye to my dearest Hanaivaz. Here are some pictures of us working together, as well as Eric, my colleague who is technically my superior for this project.\n\n\nOne time I took a toilet break and found my other classmate Mergen in my spot, causally talking with Hanaivaz.\n\n\nBut yeah, this is all to say that without Hanaivaz, my Bunun skills would probably be non-existent. For instance, she coached me for the Bunun intermediate language exam and I got a really good score. The exam itself was not super hard, but without preparation it is impossible to get a passing grade. Apparently I did pretty well, because I was invited to a ceremony for people with the highest scores. Here are some pictures of that event. Let’s see if you, the reader, are any good at Where is Waldo?:\n\n\n\n\nIn the picture below, they interviewed me on stage. I already forgot what I said exactly, but I had this whole speech prepared in Bunun that I did not get to say. So here is that web exclusive, exclusively for you:\n\nSaikin hai tupaun tu Thomas. Malas Bunun tu ngan hai tupan tu Dahai. Saikin hai Taiwan Daigaku tu isnanavaan. Mazima saikin itu Bunun tu halinga. Tuza tu uninang mahtuang saikin aip tu hanian isia imu tu tanangaus matuduldul mapasadu. Tuza tu uninang. Mihumisang.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nI am Thomas. My Bunun name is Dahai. I’m a student at National Taiwan University. I like the Bunun language. Thank you very much for allowing me to stand in front of you today, seeing each other. For real, thank you. Wishing you the best.\n\n\n\nThere were some other non-indigenous students too, mostly from Japan. But the one that made the strongest impression was Pan Yu-Hsiang, a student at Tsinghua University, which also hosts an impressive linguistic department here in Taiwan, and who is really good at his indigenous languages. If I remember correctly, he is also doing Bunun, but another dialect.\n\n\nNow, as you may have noticed, I am wearing a somewhat special outfit. Hanaivaz brought these traditional clothes for me, but it was a bit last-minute. Maybe next year I’ll be wearing even more traditional clothing.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to close off this topic, here is an interview with me that was broadcast on the National Indigenous Television of Taiwan.\n\n\nNext year, (in a few months), I might be taking the newly-established mid-high level!\n\n\nVisit from my classmates of Sinology\nNext on the agenda is the visit of my classmates. This was a plan that was first conceived of a few years ago (more precisely, when I was first back in Belgium after starting my PhD – read about it here).\nSince the girls – Joke, Anneleen, Silke and Mandy – would be travelling to Shanghai afterwards and then to Inner Mongolia with another girlfriend of us, Yoana, the time in Taiwan was pretty limited. But luckily, even on a temporal budget, #temporalbudget, we can visit some nice places here.\nFor instance, there is the mandatory campus tour that I try to give / impose on all of my visitors. This starts at the main gate and goes past the Drunken Moon Lake – the forbidden lake during Ghost Month (right now) because of, well, ghosts:\n\n\n\n\nThen there are such highlights as the view from Chunky, aka Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall:\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, life is not a pony camp. We did some calisthenic sports and foot torture as well:\n\n\n\n\nOf course, temples were also on the menu. Here are the Confucius temple and the Baoan Gong:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis and countless (okay, not countless, but a lot, given the time that was allowed) other things we did. For instance, we went to hot springs together in Beitou, walked around Tamsui (my hair is horrible in these pictures, pls ignore), went to sing karaoke in the shady Japanese ktv that has a surprising large amount of English songs, ate hot pot, talked about cows and calves, did the necessary gossiping etc.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the one that was a first for me in Taiwan was (finally) taking a trip to Yangmingshan, named after Wang Yangming 王陽明, one of the four great Confucianists – although I think recently he has fallen a bit off his pedestal.\nSo, we met at the MRT, in our best hiking outfit.\n\n\nAnd then we took the bus to the mountain trail. Since I had never been there, I did not know how long it was going to last. This fact, however, did not seem to have made through to Anneleen, who kept asking every ten minutes if we still had a long way to go, and I just kept saying, “I think it’s about half an hour left”. About one and a half hour later (or so it felt) we finally arrived at the highest trail, where we hiked a bit up and down. We even got to see dinosaurs!\n\n\nAnd CJ saw a snake (no pic sorry).\n\n\n\n\nBut yeah, this literally was the highest point of their visit. And as you can see from the real emotions caught on camera below, I was very reluctant to see them go. I really hope they can visit again, so we can venture more out of Taipei and into the Great Beyond.\n\n\n\n\nMemorable moments\nTo conclude this udpate, here are some funny or memorable moments that I cannot deny you guys.\nRemember when, the department was transformed into a wushu (for Western audience, read ‘kung fu’) camp?\n\n\nRemember when, I ran into Austin from my summer school 4 (four!!) years ago, randomly roaming around on the streets? Good luck with your restaurant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\n\nRemember when, we had a dinner date with CJ, Saito and Emily? That was some good ramen!\n\n\nRemember when, we had pizza and Greg wanted some of the spicy whatever-that-is in the jar and the jar decided that it would grant ALL OF THE SPICINESS!\n\n\nAnd finally, remember when we discovered a bar that has happy hours and is now our weekly week-closener?\n\n\n\n\nThe North Remembers."

    "text": "Hi, reader. Since I am doing research most of the time and somewhat struggling with the question of what I should let out of the bag and on this blog, my findings have still only made their ways to research conferences, some articles, and my notes, instead of ending up on this platform as well. So, as it has turned out to be difficult to keep this blog updated, a catch-up blog is warranted. Last update, published in August, and talking about events until April, was already an attempt to do so. However, with the new year going strong, it’s time to quickly and efficiently share with you some moments that really made my (last) year.\nWhat I envision, then, is a selection of the best moments that were captured on camera, provided with (snarky) comments. After this one blog, I plan to give some more research-related updates as well.\n\nField work on / trip to Orchid Island\nJust like I took my linguistic fieldwork class in my first year here – on Isbukun Bunun, for which I had e-lectures last semester,\n\n\n– last year’s master students had to study one of the aboriginal languages of Taiwan. That year it was Yami, also known as Tao. The Tao people live on Orchid island (Lányǔ 蘭嶼), an island off the coast of Taiwan. See the map for its location:\n\n\nThe Tao speak a language that’s more closely related to Phillippine languages, more precisely the Batanic islands, a small archipelago located south of Orchid island. And even though these languages appear to be mutually intelligible, it is not allowed to enter Taiwan or the Phillippines by just taking a boat to the other island – no, you have to go all the way to an aiport (Taipei? Kaohsiung?) that flies to Manila in the Phillippines, and then take a boat to these Batanic islands. It’s crazy and inefficient.\nAnyway, my first photo is the flying fish (libangbang) that are eaten all over the island. They are caught and hung (hanged? :p) to dry.\n\n\nAs we got closer to the island, it just looked like Jurassic park:\n\n\nAnd then there is the amazing Mantou mountain – which is a holy mountain for the Tao people. We were staying in a bay next to it, and it provided me with a view that will be very hard to forget.

It is also the location of the Southern Branch of the National Palace Museum 故宮南院. When we were there, the first thing that you notice is the unusual shape of the building. I hope this picture does justice to the super cool architecture:\n\n\nHere is a selection of fine brush paintings. I love how there is a contrast between thicker lines and slight touches to fill out the rest. Like many Chinese paintings, the painting is only partially construed by the artist, the other half has to be imagined by the viewer. This way, paintings really become interactive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there were also the two wrestlers.\n\n\nAnd the doggies by Castiglione."

The cheeky Chinese of the Ming dynasty transliterated this as dǎ gǒu 打狗 ‘hitting the dog’. Then, fast forwarding a bit, the Japanese eventually took control of Taiwan after the Shimonoseki treaty in 1895, and also took this ‘takao’ as the name, but gave it characters that fit with this pronunciation: taka 高 and ō 雄. So that’s how this place went from a bamboo forest, where they hit dogs to being a big hero (高雄 ‘tall hero’).\nThey have a beautiful public library, which was the first place we went after checking in at our hotel near the train station, very presumably also the red light district…\n\n\nAnother landmark of Kaohsiung, 85 Sky Tower. It’s tall tower with – how did you guess – 85 floors. It’s 347.5 m tall and meant to look like the character 高, which, as you no doubt remember from two a few lines above, is how you write Kaoshiung in Chinese."

But one of a scale I’d never seen before. To give you an idea, here is a picture from one of the higher points in the complex:\n\n\nAnd here is the same picture with two linguistics for scale:\n\n\nThey had many different exhibitions throughout the monastary, explaining the history of the Buddhist cult as well as the history of the place itself. I was a little bit afraid there would be this conversion message to all visitors, but they did not really harass you with that. On the contrary, they tried to emphasize all the good sides of (their version of) Buddhism. Noteworthy is the restaurant all the way in the back, where they serve some really good veggie food for foodies and non-foodies all alike.\nOf course, they possess a relic of Buddha: a tooth in this case. It was very interesting to see how this relic is venerated by pilgrims and tourists as they pass by. It can be found in the main shrine of the monastary:\n\n\nSo, all in all, I would definitely recommend people visiting this monastary."

It’s a tram.) I feel that the whole implementation of a tram system in Kaohsiung hasn’t been thoroughly thought through, but I hope it becomes more efficient once it’s completed. At the moment, you can just go from the southwest to the southeast – which is fun, we did it, but, you know, kind of slow.\nAnyways, Pier 2 offered some really nice views:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey even had their own Manneken Pis! I would say it’s dormant for 90% of the time, but lo-and-behold, it started peeing just as we arrived:\n\n\nAfterwards, we walked a bit further onto the old British consulated and had a fancy high tea, savouring not only the bites of this treat, but also the view of the beautiful National Sun Yat-Sen University 中山大學. Can I have a campus located next to the ocean?\n\n\nAnd we also ran into an old classmate from a group project I had done that semester. I lost the pictures I took of him, but he took a picture of the two of us:\n\n\nFinally, after having been to the Buddhist monastary, the light of the Buddha was within me. That is why I meditated beneath the bodhi tree and only stood up after the light was good and a nice picture of me had been taken."

CJ had done his military service in a local aboriginal village of the Paiwan 排灣 tribe on the mountain. So to the village of Sandimen 三地門, Timur in Paiwan, we were headed for the day. It was really interesting to meet up with some of CJ’s old colleagues in the local elementary school. And we had a really good dinner with some of his closest friends that evening, which I would sign up for again anytime.\nPart of the Paiwan iconography are snakes, as well as phalluses (phalli?). Here’s an example:\n\n\nAfter visiting the school and the best barbecued luch I could have wanted, especially in price-value comparison, CJ took me to a nearby aboriginal park.\n\n\nThey had an interesting exhibition going on there. I like the use of the acrylic paint (what I used when I did some painting myself), and the use of different materials in the last picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this short visit to the art part and the historical exhibition that detailed the history and classification of the different aboriginal tribes in Taiwan and some of their customs, we went into the park, where we were greeted by this mural – another typical aboriignal symbol:\n\n\nThen we crossed this rainbow bridge – hanivalval is ‘rainbow’ in Bunun. Don’t you just love the sound of that word?\n\n\nWe saw huts, and the wild stream, which was lacking a bit of water.\n\n\n\n\nUntil finally, we arrived at a show! This show had all dancers portray one of the different aboriginal tribes and even singing in their language, just to immerse yourself in this culture. Super cool!!\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we crossed the tallest bridge pier in Taiwan: the 99 m high Guchuan 谷川 bridge."

That trip involved A LOT of rain, and although people always tell me “IT NEVER RAINS IN KAOHSIUNG”, I am still to enjoy a rainless time in the Big Hero.\nSo what I now will show involves secret footage of a younger (and I guess thinner?) me, my good friend Snow, who we met up with this time as well, and my excellent guide from that time Robert, taken from the Cijin lighthouse:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the generous Robert offered me some good icecream and an icecream cola float (I think that was my first ever!)\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, that time Snow took me to the Lotus Pond, so I went there again with CJ this time. Here’s me and my ride:\n\n\nSo to round up Kaohsiung and this post, here is one more picture of the city!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Aaaah, can you feel it, radiating from this picture?\n\n\nSpring was in the air. And also the in the title of this update.\nIn this update I’ll write about two main events in my Taiwan life: finding out that I passed the intermediate Isbukun Bunun exam and the visit of my lovely classmates from Sinology, back in the day. Have fun reading!\n\nPassing the Bunun exam\nThose among you who have been avid readers of my blog for a longer time probably know that a few years ago, I got the chance to study one of the indigenous languages of Taiwan. The language we did that year in our fieldwork class was Bunun, and to be more precise the Isbukun dialect.\nIf you are suddenly falling out of the sky, not knowing what in the world I am talking about, I advise you to read this post. And if you are already firm on the ground, you can also read it again, as a friendly reminder.\nAnyway, after that semester, I have also been working on the Bunun part of the Formosan Spoken Language corpus, as I also mentioned here. Well, now the language elicitation is finally coming to an end, and I have had to say temporary goodbye to my dearest Hanaivaz. Here are some pictures of us working together, as well as Eric, my colleague who is technically my superior for this project.\n\n\nOne time I took a toilet break and found my other classmate Mergen in my spot, causally talking with Hanaivaz.\n\n\nBut yeah, this is all to say that without Hanaivaz, my Bunun skills would probably be non-existent. For instance, she coached me for the Bunun intermediate language exam and I got a really good score. The exam itself was not super hard, but without preparation it is impossible to get a passing grade. Apparently I did pretty well, because I was invited to a ceremony for people with the highest scores. Here are some pictures of that event. Let’s see if you, the reader, are any good at Where is Waldo?:\n\n\n\n\nIn the picture below, they interviewed me on stage. I already forgot what I said exactly, but I had this whole speech prepared in Bunun that I did not get to say. So here is that web exclusive, exclusively for you:\n\nSaikin hai tupaun tu Thomas. Malas Bunun tu ngan hai tupan tu Dahai. Saikin hai Taiwan Daigaku tu isnanavaan. Mazima saikin itu Bunun tu halinga. Tuza tu uninang mahtuang saikin aip tu hanian isia imu tu tanangaus matuduldul mapasadu. Tuza tu uninang. Mihumisang.\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nI am Thomas. My Bunun name is Dahai. I’m a student at National Taiwan University. I like the Bunun language. Thank you very much for allowing me to stand in front of you today, seeing each other. For real, thank you. Wishing you the best.\n\n\n\nThere were some other non-indigenous students too, mostly from Japan. But the one that made the strongest impression was Pan Yu-Hsiang, a student at Tsinghua University, which also hosts an impressive linguistic department here in Taiwan, and who is really good at his indigenous languages. If I remember correctly, he is also doing Bunun, but another dialect.\n\n\nNow, as you may have noticed, I am wearing a somewhat special outfit. Hanaivaz brought these traditional clothes for me, but it was a bit last-minute. Maybe next year I’ll be wearing even more traditional clothing.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to close off this topic, here is an interview with me that was broadcast on the National Indigenous Television of Taiwan.\n\n\nNext year, (in a few months), I might be taking the newly-established mid-high level!\n\n\nVisit from my classmates of Sinology\nNext on the agenda is the visit of my classmates. This was a plan that was first conceived of a few years ago (more precisely, when I was first back in Belgium after starting my PhD – read about it here).\nSince the girls – Joke, Anneleen, Silke and Mandy – would be travelling to Shanghai afterwards and then to Inner Mongolia with another girlfriend of us, Yoana, the time in Taiwan was pretty limited. But luckily, even on a temporal budget, #temporalbudget, we can visit some nice places here.\nFor instance, there is the mandatory campus tour that I try to give / impose on all of my visitors. This starts at the main gate and goes past the Drunken Moon Lake – the forbidden lake during Ghost Month (right now) because of, well, ghosts:\n\n\n\n\nThen there are such highlights as the view from Chunky, aka Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall:\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, life is not a pony camp. We did some calisthenic sports and foot torture as well:\n\n\n\n\nOf course, temples were also on the menu. Here are the Confucius temple and the Baoan Gong:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis and countless (okay, not countless, but a lot, given the time that was allowed) other things we did. For instance, we went to hot springs together in Beitou, walked around Tamsui (my hair is horrible in these pictures, pls ignore), went to sing karaoke in the shady Japanese ktv that has a surprising large amount of English songs, ate hot pot, talked about cows and calves, did the necessary gossiping etc.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the one that was a first for me in Taiwan was (finally) taking a trip to Yangmingshan, named after Wang Yangming 王陽明, one of the four great Confucianists – although I think recently he has fallen a bit off his pedestal.\nSo, we met at the MRT, in our best hiking outfit.\n\n\nAnd then we took the bus to the mountain trail. Since I had never been there, I did not know how long it was going to last. This fact, however, did not seem to have made through to Anneleen, who kept asking every ten minutes if we still had a long way to go, and I just kept saying, “I think it’s about half an hour left”. About one and a half hour later (or so it felt) we finally arrived at the highest trail, where we hiked a bit up and down. We even got to see dinosaurs!\n\n\nAnd CJ saw a snake (no pic sorry).\n\n\n\n\nBut yeah, this literally was the highest point of their visit. And as you can see from the real emotions caught on camera below, I was very reluctant to see them go. I really hope they can visit again, so we can venture more out of Taipei and into the Great Beyond.\n\n\n\n\nMemorable moments\nTo conclude this udpate, here are some funny or memorable moments that I cannot deny you guys.\nRemember when, the department was transformed into a wushu (for Western audience, read ‘kung fu’) camp?\n\n\nRemember when, I ran into Austin from my summer school 4 (four!!) years ago, randomly roaming around on the streets? Good luck with your restaurant in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\n\nRemember when, we had a dinner date with CJ, Saito and Emily? That was some good ramen!\n\n\nRemember when, we had pizza and Greg wanted some of the spicy whatever-that-is in the jar and the jar decided that it would grant ALL OF THE SPICINESS!\n\n\nAnd finally, remember when we discovered a bar that has happy hours and is now our weekly week-closener?\n\n\n\n\nThe North Remembers."

    "section": "Red: output",
    "text": "Red: output\nI first start with the output part, because I am pretty proud of that. This workflow has been a few years in the making, but about a year ago, I already had a pretty good flow I felt: for school (university) work, I would typically first access Google Scholar, library websites or other databases, or more general books or articles. The records returned I would then store in a reference manager, such as Zotero, and in a note taking app, such as Evernote. I plan to do an overview of this “gathering” phase of research in a future blog post, as it is quite crucial to the way I do things — it is pretty customized, but I believe it is a very adoptable approach. Then, from Evernote (and the preceding books, articles etc.) I would start to write my papers, of course interacting with new data in other databases, or annotation tools such as Markus or corpora such as Sketch Engine. Then, as a word processor, I would — as I suppose most of my peers would — use MS Office programs such as Word, Powerpoint4, or Excel. It must be said that by last year Excel has been slowly replaced by open source variants such as LibreOffice’s Calc, for the simple reason that the Windows suite tends to use a lot of hidden code that (can) severely mixes up the data when you import it into R or Python. So, for output formats, posters would usually come from Powerpoint; and documents from Word (in PDF) format. These I would then store locally, in cloud formats such as Dropbox and Google Drive, as well as on a regular back-up hard drive. Other dissimination includes of course, book chapters, (future) Journal articles, but also such services as Academia.edu. The status of the last one is still not entirely clear, though: it is for profit, but it also has a very low threshold and the publishers are afraid of it because they see their ginormous profits trimmed down slightly."

Other news media I peruse include a Belgian newspaper, De Morgen (although I sometimes follow the rabbit hole to less-reputable Het Laatste News “the latest news”). Then, of course, we cannot deny the social aspect of news these days - which I think is where this whole PLN analysis shows its value: Reddit (for Taiwanese readers: 「非台灣人的PTT」) is an online forum where literally everything can be discussed. Facebook and Instagram are very informative as well, although their fun and thus slightly addictive nature must not be denied."

As I am in the position of having to deal with Europe, China and Taiwan, I have become subject to installing three different apps, depending on the dominant one in the region: Line for Taiwan, WeChat for China, and WhatsApp for Europe. And, as my good friend Guillermo aptly remarked:\n\nAy Tomás, they are all fucking green!\n\nYes. They are. And I always press on the wrong one…\nOther apps in this category include the professional network site LinkedIN. I get a lot of ‘friend’ requests on this one, but I don’t really use it to its fullest potential, although I like to think that is because academia ‘works differently’. Let’s see how the future thinks about that.\nThen, almost lastly, there are the social movie check site iCheck Movies and the social book reading site Goodreads, which I occassionally add the things I read. Note that I have to read many books for my PhD, and I already catalogue them in Zotero and Evernote, so I don’t always update these accounts.\nLastly, we have Twitter, where I very sporadically unleash a tweet upon the world. I hope you catch them when I do."

Then, fast forwarding a bit, the Japanese eventually took control of Taiwan after the Shimonoseki treaty in 1895, and also took this ‘takao’ as the name, but gave it characters that fit with this pronunciation: taka 高 and ō 雄. So that’s how this place went from a bamboo forest, where they hit dogs to being a big hero (高雄 ‘tall hero’).\nThey have a beautiful public library, which was the first place we went after checking in at our hotel near the train station, very presumably also the red light district…\n\n\nAnother landmark of Kaohsiung, 85 Sky Tower. It’s tall tower with – how did you guess – 85 floors.

I was a little bit afraid there would be this conversion message to all visitors, but they did not really harass you with that. On the contrary, they tried to emphasize all the good sides of (their version of) Buddhism. Noteworthy is the restaurant all the way in the back, where they serve some really good veggie food for foodies and non-foodies all alike.\nOf course, they possess a relic of Buddha: a tooth in this case. It was very interesting to see how this relic is venerated by pilgrims and tourists as they pass by. It can be found in the main shrine of the monastary:\n\n\nSo, all in all, I would definitely recommend people visiting this monastary."

That trip involved A LOT of rain, and although people always tell me “IT NEVER RAINS IN KAOHSIUNG”, I am still to enjoy a rainless time in the Big Hero.\nSo what I now will show involves secret footage of a younger (and I guess thinner?) me, my good friend Snow, who we met up with this time as well, and my excellent guide from that time Robert, taken from the Cijin lighthouse:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the generous Robert offered me some good icecream and an icecream cola float (I think that was my first ever!)\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, that time Snow took me to the Lotus Pond, so I went there again with CJ this time. Here’s me and my ride:\n\n\nSo to round up Kaohsiung and this post, here is one more picture of the city!"

Now, Google scholar is also not without problems. The question remains, however, if your institution has access to the paper you are looking for. Usually that is okay, but for some you may be linked to the publisher, where you have to pay for access to the paper. One of the more recent big issues in academia is the cry for more open-access, and we are still trying to find a viable model that does not waste the people’s tax money, but still keeps things like peer-review alive. A really good model hasn’t been found yet, but I have the feeling we are getting there.\nAnyway, assuming you do have access to the paper you want, what to do next — that is the issue at stake in this update. Let’s download the thing!"

I am very greatful to have had that opportunity, as it brought me into contact with some other researchers of ideophones, like Keiko Murasugi and Emily Lake, and strenghtened the relations with other scholars I had met before, like Kimi Akita or Arthur Thompson.\nI will now embed the presentation I gave over there, so you can leisurely scroll through it. Should it take a long time to load or fail to do so, click here to go the figshare upload (it is a pretty big file; 5.2 MB).\n\n\nSo the next day, after the invited speech in Nagoya and the accompanying dinner which was nomihōdai 飲み放題 and tabehoudai 食べ放題 — “all you can drink and eat”, I went to collect my Japan Rail Pass that I had ordered before going to Japan. I made some calculations and for me this was cheaper than buying my tickets locally, and certainly most time-efficient. However, you can still travel more cheaply by taking Japan’s non-highspeed trains. So I got to the station and the person behind the desk me fill out the pass three times because apparently “you can’t mix languages” or whatever. But I did get my pass. And I did take my train, to Kanazawa. Here is a random picture I took during the trainride."

    "text": "Kanazawa\nAi, beautiful Kanazawa. There is no other way to put it. Kana-“the golden swamp”zawa 金沢 is located in the North of the Middle of Japan, if that geographical description makes any sense. The city was historically important, as it was (one of?) the biggist feudal domain within the shōgunate. It was ruled by the Maeda 前田 clan, who ruled from their castle across the beautiful garden etc.\nSo what was I doing in Kanazawa? I went to visit my friend Bert Collin, who was my kōhai 後輩 at Leuven University (making me his sempai 先輩 — kind of like an older-younger student relation) and our student organisation Eoos. While I studied Sinology, he was studying Japanology, and became one of my best friends. He’s now affiliated to the JET programme as the representative of Belgium’s Ghent city, which is a sister city of Kanazawa. Read this interview with him on our friend Sheena’s blog, or read his own blog (which is also in need of updates, chop chop Bert!). Now, let the pictures begin! Let’s start with what’s left of the castle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Kanazawa is still famous today as the biggest producer of gold leaf, which in Dutch is called the other way around blad-goud ‘leaf-gold’, but in Chinese and Japanese jīnbó or kimpaku 金箔 ‘gold-foil’. Whatever be its name, it is beautiful and Kanazawa is made completely out of it. We went to the old geisha disctrict (I think — I don’t seem to recall geisha’s) where you could buy whatever you want in gold leaf. I didn’t really buy any souvenirs, having been introduced to goldstrike and other unearthly drinks during my studies, but I did wipe the sweat of my face with a gold leaf sweat paper.\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards Bert had to go back to work and I was left to explore the beautfiul Kenroku-en garden.\n\n\nWhere Bert works.\nThe first thing I need to tell you guys about are the huge spiders. Quickly scroll through if you can’t handle them.\n\n\n\n\nNow, beautiful pictures of the garden. Warning, they may make you want to go check out Kanazawa yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmidst the garden I saw a little gardenhouse (Seisonkaku Villa) and decided to take the tour. This doll apparently survived the great burning of Kanazawa and is therefore haunted.\n\n\n\n\nI loved these girls’s kimono.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to take my wedding pictures in Kanazawa.\n\n\nAlso, I met Belgian celebrity Margriet Hermans who sat on a bench in the garden. Apparently there was a whole tour group of Belgians that were dropped off there and were wandering through the beautiful scenery.\n\n\nOther beautiful things that Kanazawa is rich are the Oyama-jinja 尾山神社 shrine. Look how tranquil it was, I had some sort of godswood experience when I was there.\n\n\nThe last day Bert took me to the Contemporary Art museum where we swam without getting wet.\n\n\n\n\nAnd also to the Daisetzu Suzuki Museum, where they built a space that attempted to achieve Suzuki “Buddhist teacher to the West” Daisetsu’s dream of meditation and reflection.\n\n\nThey often say wisdom comes from a child’s mouth, and the child in the picture was a saint, transferring upon us the teaching of “pen. pinapple. apple. pen.” (see here if you don’t know what that means.)\nAfter this it was time to say goodbye to Bert and move on to Tōkyo, where I had been last year, but now again, and better."

I am just going to list the temples I visited: Engakuji 円覚寺, Kenchōji 建長寺 (by now you probably figured out that ji means ‘temple’), Tsurugaoka Hachiman gu 鶴岡八幡宮, and the Kōtoku-in with the Big Buddha 鎌倉大仏殿高徳院.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTōkyo has so much to offer, besides beautiful daytrips like Kamakura and I really want to go back there again (although I must first go to Kyōto and Nara to feed the deer before I return to this part of Japan). Anto and Ale were really good hosts (even though they might have felt they were spending too little time with me - no worries, I managed!) and took to me to all these other places where I didn’t take pictures, but which I am happy to share some stories of if you ask me :) ."

    "text": "Red: output\nI first start with the output part, because I am pretty proud of that. This workflow has been a few years in the making, but about a year ago, I already had a pretty good flow I felt: for school (university) work, I would typically first access Google Scholar, library websites or other databases, or more general books or articles. The records returned I would then store in a reference manager, such as Zotero, and in a note taking app, such as Evernote. I plan to do an overview of this “gathering” phase of research in a future blog post, as it is quite crucial to the way I do things — it is pretty customized, but I believe it is a very adoptable approach. Then, from Evernote (and the preceding books, articles etc.) I would start to write my papers, of course interacting with new data in other databases, or annotation tools such as Markus or corpora such as Sketch Engine. Then, as a word processor, I would — as I suppose most of my peers would — use MS Office programs such as Word, Powerpoint4, or Excel. It must be said that by last year Excel has been slowly replaced by open source variants such as LibreOffice’s Calc, for the simple reason that the Windows suite tends to use a lot of hidden code that (can) severely mixes up the data when you import it into R or Python. So, for output formats, posters would usually come from Powerpoint; and documents from Word (in PDF) format. These I would then store locally, in cloud formats such as Dropbox and Google Drive, as well as on a regular back-up hard drive. Other dissimination includes of course, book chapters, (future) Journal articles, but also such services as Academia.edu. The status of the last one is still not entirely clear, though: it is for profit, but it also has a very low threshold and the publishers are afraid of it because they see their ginormous profits trimmed down slightly."

I get a lot of ‘friend’ requests on this one, but I don’t really use it to its fullest potential, although I like to think that is because academia ‘works differently’. Let’s see how the future thinks about that.\nThen, almost lastly, there are the social movie check site iCheck Movies and the social book reading site Goodreads, which I occassionally add the things I read.

As you can see, there are different ‘categories’ in my life that are dominated by different apps, and I am sure that for most of my readers, it must be very similar, whether you are a linguistics student or otherwise engaged with the world!\nIn the next update I will go over what has changed, but it mostly concerns the whole research output section. In the meantime, I hope you can think a bit about which apps influence you in your daily life. And I hope that you even chart your PLN, so we can compare!

Now, Google scholar is also not without problems. The question remains, however, if your institution has access to the paper you are looking for. Usually that is okay, but for some you may be linked to the publisher, where you have to pay for access to the paper. One of the more recent big issues in academia is the cry for more open-access, and we are still trying to find a viable model that does not waste the people’s tax money, but still keeps things like peer-review alive. A really good model hasn’t been found yet, but I have the feeling we are getting there.\nAnyway, assuming you do have access to the paper you want, what to do next — that is the issue at stake in this update. Let’s download the thing!"

    "text": "Howdy cowboys and cowgirls!\nIn this post I’ll talk about the trip I went on to UK this summer, which took place after the events chronicled in last time’s post “Hashtag Travels With Bae”. Since I am of a recycling nature, I wanted to reuse that title, hence this one is called “Travels with bae in UK”. The trip we took was about 10 days long and was a real Journey To the West: we first went to London for a night, then to Oxford, subsequently Bristol with a day trip to Bath, then to Cardiff and then back to London with an excursion to Cambridge. Here is our route on the map:\n\nLondon\nWe took the Eurostar to London from Brussels-Midi (which is called Brussel-Zuid in Dutch — a very confusing nomenclature that must discourage tourists travelling to the Brussels region, if not for other reasons like peeing boys, peeing girls, or a giant building made of balls). It was my first time taking this train and it went really well; I was super surprised by how fast we made it to Lille in France (called Rijsel in Dutch). We arrived in the Pimlico neighbourhood of London where our hostel was situated and where we were to meet up with Joke and Katrin, well-known from my year in Suzhou (read about it on this blog by looking for posts tagged ‘Suzhou’). They were also trekking Westwards the next day, to go walking in Wales; we were eventually going there with some stops along the way. So after a hot night’s sleep (the Spanish guys in our dorm insisted on closing ‘the cold window’ but sleeping in his undies) we went to Paddington station.\n Beartje Paddington\n\n\nOxford\nFrom there we went to Oxford, which for the summer had been transformed into a prospective study tour for six-year-old Chinese children. I suppose the goal was familiarising them with all the different colleges and then somehow motivating them to study really hard to get into them. The children seemed more interested in playing we-chat games with each other on their brand-new iPhones though.\n Group of Chinese tourists peeking inside a college\nI was really excited to go to Oxford, actually, and I think we should have spent more time there than we did. However, we did get to see some really great things. One of these things is the Ashmolean Museum, the world’s first university museum, established in 1683, when I was -308 years old. There are these futuristic dog sculptures guarding the door and inside there are many cool (yet old) things. Here are some pictures.\n The dog\n Manchu writing\n A game set\n Christian hugs (if I remember correctly these are St. Peter and St. Paul, also the saints that the church of Loenhout city is named after)\n Classical statues\nOf course, Oxford is most famous for its university, so we did try to do some ‘college hopping’. We did New College, Trinity and Balliol, among others. There ar two things that you must know about these places. 1) All colleges look very beautiful, but some look more beautiful than others. They all have the same colour as well. 2) There is some whacky pronunciation game going on with them. For instance, Magdalen College is pronounced /ˈmɔːdlɪn/, but that’s not what’s written there; and Balliol is /ˈbeɪliəl/.\n One of them colleges\n Exeter?\n Christ Church college\n Trinity\n Trinity\n Balliol\n Balliol\n Radcliffe Camera. Yes, it was raining.\nApart from the colleges, Oxford is also famous for J.R.R. Tolkien, who used to hang out with his bros in a pub called The Eagle And Child. We went there.\n The Eagle and Child\nAnd semi-related to this: our hostel room was in Lord of the Rings-themed! This may have been the most important reason I wanted to go to Oxford in the first place, as I was semi-obsessed with Tolkien’s universe this summer.\n The Fellowship of the Ring\n Map of Middle Earth\n\n\nBristol\nAfter our trip to Oxford it was time to take the Great Western Railway to Bristol, ever the upcoming city of the UK. I knew nothing about this city and I don’t know if I know much more now. The city needs some time to grow on you but after three days I felt alright with it, though I doubt it will become my favourite place-to-be. As we found out, there is a lot of work in the city, if you’re a bit creative (think graffiti). There is also a lot of unemployment and many homeless people. It took a while to become immune to really kind requests for leftover change, because you want to help them but you know it’s an institutionalised problem that one person can’t change. On to better aspects of the city: the art of street artist Banksy — I couldn’t find a photo to put here ;‑) . But he did make some nice stencils and graffiti throughout Bristol.\n The Mild Mild West\n The Hung lovers\n Death\n Not everything is made by Banksy. This was also beautiful and located behind a church in a city wall!\n\n\nBath\nBristol is the perfect base to do a day trip to Bath, an ancient Roman spa that has been turned into a nice museum. It is worth going there, although the water doesn’t look very attractive. This is because the sunlight promotes the growth of algae in the hot spring (still hot!). This problem could be easily solved if they would put a roof over the baths and I really wish they would, to recreate the Roman experience (I’m not asking them to turn it in a modern spa but in an ancient one). The city itself is very nice to walk through. It reminds me a bit of my time in Brugge (good for a day but will you stay there longer?). That being said, it’s a bit more rural and full of old buildings that do remind you of the historicity of the city, in every corner. There’s also a really great coffee shop, Colonna and Smalls, that CJ took me to where we had a great afternoon coffee break. Bath deserves a visit!\n Bath water\n Golden head\n Some real Roman engineering. This transports the hot water from the holy hot spring to the public baths\n Royal Crescent\n Bath abbey and its lovely gulls\n\n\nCardiff\nAfter Bristolling and taking a Bath we ventured even more to the West, to the capital of Wales: Cardiff (or as is written everywhere there: Caerdydd). It is a bit strange that think that in the capital of Wales, the only Welsh you hear is in the train stations, but hardly on the streets. I felt a bit disappointed. But then again, for ‘the real Wales’ you should probably go more to the Northwest and go walking around (“Walking in Wales”, as Katrin and Joke were busy doing). After arriving in our air bnb, we took a trip to the National Museum of Cardiff (time constraints). We saw dinosaurs and Agatha Christies.\n Flying dinosaur\n “How’s your head?” - “Haven’t had any complaints”\n Hello dodo :D\n Turtle skeleton + shell!\n Portrait of Agatha Christie\n books by Agatha Christie\nThat the Welsh are proud of their differences as compared to the English is very obvious though. You can see it in funny takes on literary classics for instance:\n In this photo they ‘Welshized’ the titles of these famous works. My personal favourite is Catch me if you can, transformed in Cwtch me if you can. A cwtch is a ‘hug’ in Welsh.\nAnother instance where you can see their Welshness is in their ability to smack a dragon on anything. The rainbow flag for instance:\n\nIn Cardiff you can also visit the beautiful Cardiff Castle, aptly named because it is a castle in Cardiff. The oldest parts have been there since Roman times, which then were improved upon in Mediaeval times and supplied with an extra 18th century castle later on.\n The site of Cardiff Castle\nWhen we went there, the weather was not cooperating. This is mainly due to the bad weather Wales gets in general. However, there is enough inside and outside sights to see on the castle site. You can go all the way up the old castle [built on a mound!], and you can explore the aristocratic lifestyle of the Bute family, which held the site for many a year.\n Swag selfie\n The ‘new’ castle and a bit of Cardiff behind it\n The Arab room inside the Bute castle\n Library of the Bute family\n Ancient scripts!!!! From left to right, we see Ancient Greek, Cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Hebrew[?].\nAfter visiting the old castle and the new one, we did the last ‘attraction’: a walk through the tunnels that emulated what it was like during the WWII. We got all the way to the end of one tunnel and saw a poster talking about the benefits of handkerchiefs, so I of course tried to tell CJ about these benefits. I opened my mouth and all of a sudden a voice came from in around the corner: “Thomas???” (In perfect Flemish Dutch, even perfect recognisable sounds). We had run into Joke and Katrin. Their walking tour in Wales had taken them to Cardiff castle where they were walking through the dark tunnel. It was such a coincidence, but it’s always nice to meet your friends in this big world that at times seems very small.\n In the tunnel\n The girls were almost blown away\nWell, after a nice chit and a good chat we walked out of the castle and each group went its own ways. Joke and Katrin went on walking to the train station, where they would go to Bath (we recommended it), then to London. And in London they would see Aladdin the musical, do some day trips to Cambridge and Ipswich [they were very obsessed with the funny sounding name] and meet us again for Chinese hot pot when we got to London as well. Team Taiwan went on to the Dr. Who Experience, an experience that was very similar to the Harry Potter exhibition I visited last year in Brussels.\n The harbour\nIt was a nice and loooong walk to the harbour where the Experience was located in a hangar. But it was so worth it. Now, the Experience itself was this interactive play where we had to save the universe, following a guide in the ‘Gallifreyan museum’. He took us through some of the more famous monsters in the Dr. Who universe [called the ‘Whoniverse’ with a very forced blended word]. And some people there were really excited about it. One girl was dressed as the TARDIS, the blue police box the Doctor travels in. Below I’ll just show some pictures from the exhibition part, because it was awesome!\nTARDIS girl\n TARDIS on the inside\n Me and the Face of Boe\n CJ and an Ood\n Mummy on the Orient Express\n River Song’s outfits\n CJ meets the Daleks\n I turn into wood\n CJ being deleted by the Cybermen\n Crazy Cat Lady nurse [coincidentally the first episode I watched] and the robots from The Girls in the Fireplace\n Don’t Blink\n I bet you blinked.\n Davros.\n TARDIS for Clara\n Costumes of the all the Doctors, and random guy\n\n\nSaint Fagans\nWe also did a small day trip from Cardiff to Saint Fagans, which can only be described as ‘the Bokrijk of Wales’ and I urge them to start promoting themselves in this way. In this picturesque park you will see farms, barns and sheds, as well as some iron age reconstructions of huts.\n CJ and a hut-barn-shed-farm\nYou may (rightly?) think that you don’t feel like walking a whole day in this park, BUT apart from it being free, you also get to see a BEAUTIFUL castle. When I laid eyes upon it I knew the whole day trip had been worth my while. I mean, yes it’s nice to see sheds, farms, barns and huts, but we get them in Loenhout as well, you know. Castles (of this type) are a different thing.\n Wowzersss, Saint Fagans castle\n Garden next to the castle\n Secret Garden?\nSo yeah, with this our adventure in Wales came to an end. We said our goodbyes to the neighbourhood we were living at and to the beautiful Welsh language, never spoken in Cardiff, only seen, as on the Millennium Centre.\n Neighbourhood\n IN THESE STONES HORIZONS SING (by Karl Jenkins, check out the composition here) CREU GWIR FEL GWYDR O FFWRNAIS AWEN [Creating Truth Like Glass From Inspiration’s Furnace]\n\n\nLondon\nTaking the Great Western Railway (I just find the name so imposing that I already wrote it twice in this update) back Eastwards to London. We arrived in Greenwich, where we had our air bnb, and it was a very nice host in a nice place. He told us about how you can take the ferry as part of the public transport system (something you can actually also do in Prague!!), so that’s what we did to go from Greenwich all the way to Westminster, the next day that is. The first evening we were having hot pot with Joke and Katrin, remember?? (If not look up)\n Us on the catamaran\n The London Eye\n Westminster Abbey\n Trafalgar square\n Lion at Nelson’s column with Chinese boy\nAfter this water and road tour of touristy London, we went to National Portrait Gallery, where we were greeted by this era’s favourite redhead, Ed Sheeran.\n Ed Sheeran\nOf course he was not the only VIP present. Here are some more:\n Amy ‘BYOB’ Winehouse\n Queen Elizabeth ‘I’m still here’ II\n Tom ‘Loki in the Marvel universe’ Hiddleston\n Dame Maggie ’McGonnagall/Anderling/Downton Abbey is my b*tch’ Smith\n Dame Judi ‘M recently opened a Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India’ Dench\n Pocahontas Realness\n Oscar ‘Is this Stephen Fry’ Wilde\n Alexander ‘I make dresses’ McQueen and Isabella ‘I edit magazines’ Blow. This was also the Portrait of the Day, so we got the chance to listen to a detailed discussion of it. Well worth it.\nThen we went to that other museum in London — the British Museum. Tip from my anglophile friend Cedric: Take the back entrance. So we did that, wrenching our way into the museum between all the Korean tour groups. And lo and behold, we were greeted by a Moai (Easter Island statue), whose name apparently is Hoa Hakananai’a.\n Hoa Hakananai’a\nNext we had some Meso-American thingies: some Maya stelae and Aztec artifacts. I was also thrilled that the Museum shop had Michael D. Coe’s Breaking the Maya code, a book I had been wanting to read for some time now, and was even prepared to read a German version of it for, called Das Geheimnis der Maya-Schrift. Ein Code wird entschlüsselt. I wrote a review about the book:\n\n\nThis book fulfils what its title promises: it details how the maya glyphs were deciphered and the struggle it took the many Mayanists to get there. If you are looking for a detailed introduction to a Classical (or living) Maya language, this is not your book. Nor will you find all the glyphs that have been deciphered so far with all their variants. No, what you do get is more to the core and possibly more interesting: an introduction to how the system worked and how it was suited to its needs. We get a comparative chapter on other ancient writing systems, with special attention to Egyptian hieroglyphs and their decipherment in the 19th century, as well as an introduction to the Maya lifestyle. This is followed by the occasional good ideas and many more bad ideas that hindered decipherment. Many other reviewers seem to think that Coe is too severe on Thompson’s role in playing down inventive ideas in the 20th century, but it seems the reason why Coe is so negative towards him is well grounded. After all, it is not uncommon in different scholarly and scientific branches to have people who are so convinced of their own right that, even in the face of irrefutable proof, they will not give in but instead become more vehement in their self-righteousnesss. An excellent example of another field is for instance how Einstein was against the mere idea of the Big Bang, now well-accepted, because it did not fit in with his own theories. It took him many years to wrap his head around it (all the while discrediting the proponents of that theory) until he adapted his own brain stuff. So, to be short, this book that had been on my want-to-read list, was a really engaging semi-autobiographical book that was informative, fun, and often very sassy. Also makes me want to become a Mayanist, but I’m already a Sinologist :)\n\n\n Maya stela\n Maya stela\n Aztec Necklace\nWe passed the Sumerian and Akkadian section, all the way towards the Egyptian mummies. Passing by some pretty thingies, you really like the museum more with every room that is discovered. I wish more museums would be free to the public, because that is what they were meant for — inciting wonder and inspiring visitors.\n CJ and a Sumerian lion\n Akkadian stela. I think it reads “Never skip leg day”.\n Super old Sumerian game, owned by my friend Céline, who is a PhD student in Assyriology in Vienna. Read her blog here (but first finish mine).\n Pretty little thingie\n Aleph in a cage\n the Death scroll &lt;3\n Old chess set\n Horse next to the Parthenon\nThis crooked horse also reminds me of one of the most vivid memories in the British Museum. In secondary school we went on a trip to London and even though we had bought all-day passes for the underground we did everything on foot. We had a fast-footed Latin teacher, whom I shall refer to as Mrs. Store, who was in love with her field and managed to install some of her passion into most of her students. I still keep in touch with her. However, as we had walked all day, we just wanted to have a small sitting break. Not much, just a minute or two. But she would not give in. “Allez joeng, we are at the Parthenon, how is it possible that you want to sit???” It would and did not happen. Nobody was sitting. But then we got at the next section, a small corridor with a small bench. And it so happened to be free. She saw the desperate look in our eyes and finally gave in. We all (about 22 people) managed to sit down on a bench that was not meant for this many people. But we did it. This is that bench.\n THE BENCH\n THE BENCH\nSo I don’t know if the British Museum knows about it, but that bench has become a museum piece itself.\n THE BENCH is very close to this horse and reposing naked man\n I have an unhealthy interest in taking pictures with Sekhmet statues\n\n\nCambridge\nOn our penultimate day we went away for a day, to Cambridge, where CJ’s twin brother TJ is doing his PhD in glaciology, although he refers to it as geology to outsiders. Like Oxford, Cambridge (which was actually founded by people who left Oxford) is essentially a university town. And like Oxford, it was overrun with Chinese. And like Oxford, there are many colleges that can be visited. Especially if you have inside connections, which we just happened to have. We had lunch at Darwin’s, then visited King’s college (where there would be a ‘monumental stone written by the Great Xu Mozhi and visited by all Chinese speaking folk on this planet that found their way to Cambridge’ but the great Xu Mozhi’s poetry is very bad (not only in English but even more so in Chinese), and I can say so because I bought an anthology and want my pounds back), Trinity college, St. John’s, Jesus college and Pembroke college, where my anglophile friend Cedric was a visiting scholar. After a a nice 5-pound-pizza with CJ’s brother and his friends, we went to St. Edmund’s college for a really interesting evening making new friends. I don’t know if it was this personal touch, but if I have to choose sides, my money now is on Cambridge rather than Oxford.\n “It hurts my eyes to look in the camera but at least I’m trying”\n Punting is a thing here\n So are cool paintings in churches\n Shout out to my man Bacon\n Let’s not forget about my man Newton\n We’re smiling\n Inside one the churches\n Okay it may have been the beautiful King’s college church\n Nice sigils you got there\n The weather could have been better, it was, later on\n “Don’t walk on the grass” so I didn’t.\n\n\nLondon, Calais, Brussels\nSo that concluded the tour of the UK as we did it. I had a blast with CJ and Joke and Katrin, even when it was unplanned :). The last day in London we went to see a play, Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap, which was nice. And then it was time to go back home. So we went to Platform 9 3/4 in King’s Cross station and took the underground to the nearby St. Pancras station, to take the Eurostar express back home. One week was left in Belgium, during which we met up with some friends and family that I miss already. On the other hand, I had a great holiday and am ready for the new academic year. Allons-y!\n Me and my luggage"

I am very greatful to have had that opportunity, as it brought me into contact with some other researchers of ideophones, like Keiko Murasugi and Emily Lake, and strenghtened the relations with other scholars I had met before, like Kimi Akita or Arthur Thompson.\nI will now embed the presentation I gave over there, so you can leisurely scroll through it. Should it take a long time to load or fail to do so, click here to go the figshare upload (it is a pretty big file; 5.2 MB).\n\n\nSo the next day, after the invited speech in Nagoya and the accompanying dinner which was nomihōdai 飲み放題 and tabehoudai 食べ放題 — “all you can drink and eat”, I went to collect my Japan Rail Pass that I had ordered before going to Japan. I made some calculations and for me this was cheaper than buying my tickets locally, and certainly most time-efficient. However, you can still travel more cheaply by taking Japan’s non-highspeed trains. So I got to the station and the person behind the desk me fill out the pass three times because apparently “you can’t mix languages” or whatever. But I did get my pass. And I did take my train, to Kanazawa. Here is a random picture I took during the trainride."

    "title": "Wrapping up 2017: Big in Japan",
    "section": "Kanazawa",
    "text": "Kanazawa\nAi, beautiful Kanazawa. There is no other way to put it. Kana-“the golden swamp”zawa 金沢 is located in the North of the Middle of Japan, if that geographical description makes any sense. The city was historically important, as it was (one of?) the biggist feudal domain within the shōgunate. It was ruled by the Maeda 前田 clan, who ruled from their castle across the beautiful garden etc.\nSo what was I doing in Kanazawa? I went to visit my friend Bert Collin, who was my kōhai 後輩 at Leuven University (making me his sempai 先輩 — kind of like an older-younger student relation) and our student organisation Eoos. While I studied Sinology, he was studying Japanology, and became one of my best friends. He’s now affiliated to the JET programme as the representative of Belgium’s Ghent city, which is a sister city of Kanazawa. Read this interview with him on our friend Sheena’s blog, or read his own blog (which is also in need of updates, chop chop Bert!). Now, let the pictures begin! Let’s start with what’s left of the castle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Kanazawa is still famous today as the biggest producer of gold leaf, which in Dutch is called the other way around blad-goud ‘leaf-gold’, but in Chinese and Japanese jīnbó or kimpaku 金箔 ‘gold-foil’. Whatever be its name, it is beautiful and Kanazawa is made completely out of it. We went to the old geisha disctrict (I think — I don’t seem to recall geisha’s) where you could buy whatever you want in gold leaf. I didn’t really buy any souvenirs, having been introduced to goldstrike and other unearthly drinks during my studies, but I did wipe the sweat of my face with a gold leaf sweat paper.\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards Bert had to go back to work and I was left to explore the beautfiul Kenroku-en garden.\n\n\nWhere Bert works.\nThe first thing I need to tell you guys about are the huge spiders. Quickly scroll through if you can’t handle them.\n\n\n\n\nNow, beautiful pictures of the garden. Warning, they may make you want to go check out Kanazawa yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmidst the garden I saw a little gardenhouse (Seisonkaku Villa) and decided to take the tour. This doll apparently survived the great burning of Kanazawa and is therefore haunted.\n\n\n\n\nI loved these girls’s kimono.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to take my wedding pictures in Kanazawa.\n\n\nAlso, I met Belgian celebrity Margriet Hermans who sat on a bench in the garden. Apparently there was a whole tour group of Belgians that were dropped off there and were wandering through the beautiful scenery.\n\n\nOther beautiful things that Kanazawa is rich are the Oyama-jinja 尾山神社 shrine. Look how tranquil it was, I had some sort of godswood experience when I was there.\n\n\nThe last day Bert took me to the Contemporary Art museum where we swam without getting wet.\n\n\n\n\nAnd also to the Daisetzu Suzuki Museum, where they built a space that attempted to achieve Suzuki “Buddhist teacher to the West” Daisetsu’s dream of meditation and reflection.\n\n\nThey often say wisdom comes from a child’s mouth, and the child in the picture was a saint, transferring upon us the teaching of “pen. pinapple. apple. pen.” (see here if you don’t know what that means.)\nAfter this it was time to say goodbye to Bert and move on to Tōkyo, where I had been last year, but now again, and better."

It’s a mish-mash of old Japanese culture, new Japanese culture and foreign influences. I think the best way is to just put the pictures and take you guys on a visual train ride.\n\n\nMeiji jingu 明治神宮\n\n\nApparently it was “wear a kimono if you’re a woman and wear a suit if you’re a man Day” and nobody had told me about it 囧\n\n\nThis guy knows where to get commemmorative stamps\n\n\nShe has been there for more than three years, Antonio assures me.\n\n\nThis is where everybody crosses in all directions.\n\n\nI am big (大) in Japan.\n\n\nthe National Museum in Ueno.\n\n\nWoodblock statues you couldn’t take pictures of. Oops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice woodblock prints by Yoshitoshi!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really really really want this screen in my future house. Or Japanese castle. One of the two.\n\n\nAntonio was too tired after work.\nThey suggested I took a daytrip to Kamakura 鎌倉, possibly known to you from the Kamakura shogunate, as well as more beautiful temples. I am just going to list the temples I visited: Engakuji 円覚寺, Kenchōji 建長寺 (by now you probably figured out that ji means ‘temple’), Tsurugaoka Hachiman gu 鶴岡八幡宮, and the Kōtoku-in with the Big Buddha 鎌倉大仏殿高徳院.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTōkyo has so much to offer, besides beautiful daytrips like Kamakura and I really want to go back there again (although I must first go to Kyōto and Nara to feed the deer before I return to this part of Japan). Anto and Ale were really good hosts (even though they might have felt they were spending too little time with me - no worries, I managed!) and took to me to all these other places where I didn’t take pictures, but which I am happy to share some stories of if you ask me :) ."

Seriously, this is the place if you want to get a lot of value. The service was impeccable, there was a public bath, the whole atmosphere was that of a traditional Japanese guesthouse (tatami as far as the eye can see), and most fun of all - the free Japanese yukata:\n\n\nWhile I spent a lot of time indoors - it was getting cold and wet - I did get to see Nagoya castle, of which I approved! twice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this, I took the meitetsu to the Nagoya’s airport. It only dawned on me that morning, at 6 o’clock or so, that the mei- and na- of both words are the same character 名. Chinese makes more sense in this way, pronouncing both as ming."

    "text": "Project description\nfrom the HKU linguistics website:\nAn English speaker who hears the Cantonese word dang would be hard-pressed to guess the correct translation (“chair”) above chance level. Some words, however, are easy to guess, for example ideophones. Ideophones are words that depict sensory imagery and exist in every spoken language. An English speaker who hears the Japanese ideophone kira-kira is very likely to guess the correct translation (“flashing”).\nWhat are the special properties of ideophones that allow speakers to easily guess their meaning? This is still not well-understood. What we do know is that ideophones rely on iconicity to be meaningful. Iconicity is a connection between form and meaning. Since ideophones are spoken, their “form” is sound. Ideophones essentially “sound like” what they mean.\nWhat we don’t know is the answer to this question: what is it about kira-kira that sounds like “flashing” to native and non-native speakers? This question is simple yet speaks to a unifying and fundamental aspect of human cognition: how do we relate sounds to the world? By striving to answer this question, our objectives feed into language acquisition, psychology, and machine learning.\nThe main goal of our project is to identify which sound properties cause ideophones to sound like what they mean. We do this by teaching ideophones from a multilingual database to a neural network. To do this, we train our network on pronunciation (e.g., kira-kira) and meaning (e.g., “flashing”) alone, replicating circumstances participants face during guessing tasks. Next, we pinpoint which sounds the neural network relied on to guess meanings more accurately.\nWe then test the psychological reality of what the neural network has learned by first asking it to generate new ideophones, then using these as stimuli in two experiments: (1) a learning study, and (2) a transmission study (a game of telephone), to see how the new ideophones “survive in the wild” as they are passed from one participant to the next.\nOur project has two impact pathways: (1) developing an open-access database of ideophones from many languages, labeled with sound-meaning mappings identified by our neural network and verified through experimental evidence, and (2) designing an open-source brain-teaser game that helps improve one’s memory, while allowing us to continue to improve our network. For (1), we convert our neural network’s training set into a searchable website. For (2), we harness the sound-meaning mappings pin-pointed by our network to design memory tasks shown to improve memory performance.\n\n\nMembers involved\n\nPI Youngah Do\nCo-I Thomas Van Hoey\nCo-I Christophe Coupe\nCo-I Harald Baayen\n\n\n\nMy role in the project\nI am a co-investigator of this project.

    "text": "Map of the sample in this project\n\n\n\nProject description\nIconicity is a fundamental aspect of language. Words are iconic when their forms reveal something about their meaning, e.g., “woof” ‘sound of a dog barking’, “zigzag” ‘running while alternating from side to side’. Iconic words can be found in any natural language. Non-iconic words can also display iconicity (e.g. size sound symbolism), especially when they belong to the core vocabulary—words that resist borrowing into other language families. It has been hypothesized that iconicity is negatively correlated with borrowability. Yet, this hypothesis has not been tested on iconic words.\nThe BORROWING ICONIC WORDS project develops two measures (phonosemantic index, borrowability index) to gauge the universality of form-meaning mappings in iconic words, and how borrowable they are, in order to study the relation between iconicity and borrowability. The project first constructs a large-scale typological database (“Depicticon”) and then applies the two measures to it. BORROWING ICONIC WORDS devotes special attention to iconic lexicons to the case study of the East and Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area.The project situates the borrowing of iconic words at the crossroads between linguistic typology, cognitive effects, and socio-cultural factors.\n\n\nMembers involved\n\nPI Thomas Van Hoey\nSupervisor Benedikt Szmrecsanyi\nSupervisor Jean-Christophe Verstraete\n\n\n\nMy role in the project\nI obtained this project as a senior postdoctoral fellow of the FWO.\n\n\nOutputs\nThe project is currently being carried out.\n\n\nWant to contribute?\nPlease contact met at thomas[DOT]vanhoey[AT]kuleuven[DOT]be\n\n\nBasic info\n\nFWO 2024\nNumber: FWO K1AFE24N\n\nFonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek KU Leuven"

    "text": "In general, I teach linguistics classes, often with a focus on quantitative methods (R), lexicology / lexical semantics, or typology. But always with a passion to help the students acquire the necessary knowledge that can act as a catalyst to further their skills in the particular subject.\nI strongly believe in fostering the curiosity of students such that they become self-propelled. It is a joy to watch students advance their mastery of techniques that were previously foreign and unknown. At the same time, I am convinced that all knowledge reinforces each other. That means that before students can be sent on their own way, they need to be presented with materials that need to be learned and practiced first (“deliberate practice”, see Bronkorst et al. 20111). It also entails that I strongly believe in honest (self-)assessments of students’ abilities at the start of the learning period and at the end. In other words, the observed development is in my opinion a great proxy for the efficacy of teaching and learning.\nDuring my teaching, I also pay particular attention to the wealth of diversity we find in language. For example, in the Intro to linguistics class I expose students to sounds (phonetics, phonology) and ways of expressing things (morphology, syntax) in a large variety of languages across the world. One aim of this class is to complement the more traditional curriculum of language-particular linguistics they are studying later on, i.e., typically WEIRD languages. A second example constitutes the class of Language variants and language varieties. The aim of this course is to specifically pay attention to variational phenomena in language, with a strong focus on inter-language variability and inter-speaker variability (see van Hout & Muysken 20162).\nI am a calm and competent teacher that takes learning seriously but does so in a humorous way. I find that the occasional joke aids in students’ understanding. After all, observing students make connections between what were once separate and distant aspects of a topic is one of the highlights of a teaching event. And that is what propels me in my teaching career."

    "text": "The proposed project provides a synchronic and diachronic study of the ba-construction in Mandarin Chinese. In essence, it is an SOV construction in which the marker ba precedes the object, which in turn is followed by the verb expressing the action affecting the object. Its structure can be represented as “subject + ba + object + verb (+ X)”. The construction is traditionally said to convey the notion of ‘disposal’, whereby ba functions as a disposal marker (or object marker). Against the backdrop of previous literature, the present project, which is based on empirical (corpus-based) qualitative and quantitative analyses, intends to provide a more comprehensive account of the Mandarin Chinese ba-construction. It encompasses three dimensions of study—a synchronic study, a diachronic study and a variationist study. Specifically, I will first design the constructional network to represent the taxonomy and hierarchy of the Mandarin Chinese ba-construction at the synchronic level, and then investigate its diachronic development, especially the change of nodes and links (both taxonomic and vertical) in the constructional network of ba-constructions, such as node creation or loss, node-external reconfiguration of the network and in/decrease in productivity and schematicity within the theoretical frameworks of grammaticalization and diachronic construction grammar. Furthermore, the Mandarin Chinese ba-construction can actually be seen as a kind of differential object marking (DOM), and hence special attention will be paid to the motivation of the rise of the Mandarin DOM, compared to the findings proffered in the literature of cross-linguistic DOM studies. Finally, the variationist study intends to investigate the factors that condition the variation between the ba-construction and the jiang-construction, and between the SOV construction (including a disposal marker such as ba) and the corresponding SVO structure without the disposal marker. This project will shed new light on the vexed issue of the origin of the ba-construction and the motivation of the rise of this Mandarin DOM. Moreover, since Chinese, as an analytic language and without inflectional morphology, is quite different from Indo-European languages, the project will serve as a useful case to check the applicability of the grammaticalization theory and the (diachronic) construction grammar. It may provide new insight into both theories. Finally, the emergence of the disposal construction is regarded as one of the five major changes in the history of Chinese (Wang, 1958). This project may thus advance our understanding of the evolution of the disposal construction in particular and the formation of the Contemporary Chinese language system in general."

More specifically, we are set to examine how the dative alternation in Mandarin is conditioned by various constraints that are syntactic (e.g. constituent weight, NP expression type), social (e.g. regional varieties), stylistic (e.g. spoken vs written) and diachronic (i.e. past vs present). To achieve such objective, the study will follow the paradigm of probabilistic grammar, which is based on the ground that factors influencing speakers’ choice of interchangeable linguistic variants are multifaceted and non-deterministic (cf. Bresnan, 2007; Barnaisch et al., 2014; Theijssen et al., 2013). Meanwhile, we are to adopt a usage-based, empirical method to approach this issue, utilizing large-scale authentic corpora and statistical regression modelling to illustrate the directions and magnitudes of multiple variables governing the Mandarin dative alternation."

    "text": "Thanks to globalization, the presence of Chinese-speaking people in Belgium is growing, and so are Heritage Learners (HL) among them. Due to the influence of the linguistic environment, local languages such as Dutch and French become the first language of Belgian Chinese descendants, while Chinese becomes their Heritage Language (HL).\nIn the field of HL studies, both identity and motivation are prominent themes (Leeman, 2015; Li & Duff, 2014), and learners’ identity and motivation are closely intertwined (He, 2010; Li & Duff, 2014). However, the majority of research has focused on their static and attribute-like nature, and only a few scholars have paid attention to the dynamic changes and interaction between motivation and identity (Choi, 2018). Since most Belgian Chinese descendants have “bicultural identities” and are “bi(multi)lingual”, their dynamic identity trajectories in the process of learning Chinese is worth investigating.\nTherefore, this research project will adopt the theoretical framework of the L2 motivational self-system (L2MSS) and Identity Negotiation Going (INT), and research tools such as semi-structured interviews, quantitative analysis and questionnaires in order to conduct a longitudinal study on the interaction between identity and motivation of Chinese descendants studying Chinese in Belgian Chinese language schools. The project is innovative in that it establishes the context for Chinese HL research in a non-English speaking context, examines the dynamic interaction between identity and motivation, and examines the Chinese HL learning of Belgian Chinese immigrant descendants from the perspectives of culture, psychology, and personal experience. The research attempts to improve academic support for this group and produce helpful recommendations for Chinese HL teaching."

    "text": "The intersection between language variation and language complexity is empirically under-researched but hugely important for linguistic theorizing. A pilot investigation in the spirit of the so-called “single meaning” approach – see Gardner et al. (2021), employing spoken English data with corpus linguistic methodology, indicates that grammatical variation (e.g., Give me one vs. Give one to me) does not complicate language production, as choice contexts do not attract dysfluencies (i.e., long pauses and um’s and uh’s). The conclusion diverges greatly from traditional theorizing about grammatical variation and optionality, which is often perceived as suboptimal and complex by linguists. Enlightened by Gardner et al. (2021), the current study aims to conduct more specific and in-depth research by adopting psychological experiments to explore the correlations between linguistic variation and language comprehension/production complexity. This project will extend discoveries by Gardner et al. (2021) and provide empirical data support for comprehending linguistic variation as an omnipresent occurrence in human languages."

In line with recent development in Cognitive Sociolinguistics, this project aims to provide a multidimensional investigation of Chinese analytic causative constructions from both synchronic and diachronic perspectives. This project is comprised of three work packages. Work package I investigates language-internal (syntactic, semantics) and language-external (variety, genre) factors affecting the alternation of the most frequently used causative markers, i.e. shi, ling, rang and jiao from a synchronic perspective. Work package II provides a diachronic analysis of Chinese analytic causative constructions. Work package III gathers converging evidence from psychological experiments to verify whether the predictions of corpus based statistical models can reflect human speakers’ preference. Given the fact that analytic causative constructions are less well studied than morphological and lexical causatives in general, this project will not only serve as an important reference for studies on Chinese causatives, but also will contribute to the discussion on analytic causative constructions from a cross-linguistic perspective."

The study investigates changes in the (constraints on) productivity of the already grammaticalized particles (which originally expressed direction) in American English and Mandarin Chinese, with particular attention on the association of register with more or less innovative use.\nThe project has three primary objectives: (i) to map the semantics and productivity (i.e., their capacity to combine with a variety of verbs) of these grammaticalized particles in American English and Mainland Mandarin Chinese from 1920 to 2020; (ii) to examine the productivity of these particles across different registers, including (for contemporary data) in web-based content, with the goal of understanding the role of register in the innovative use of verb-particle constructions in both languages; and (iii) theoretically, by looking at two unrelated languages, it particle combinations, including the question to what extent highly grammaticalized constructions in unrelated languages show parallelisms in their (post-grammaticalization) development, and whether any substantial differences can be seen as persistence effects from their earlier grammaticalization history.\nThis study is based on a comprehensive database of verb-particle combinations, drawing from multiple corpora. For English, data is sourced from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA), and Global Web-Based English (GloWbE). For Mandarin Chinese, data is collected from the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese (LCMC), the BLCU (Beijing Language and Culture University) Chinese corpus, and the Leiden Weibo Corpus. The dataset provides a balanced representation of spoken, written, and web-based registers across a 100-year period, spanning from 1920 to 2020."

    "text": "My overarching research goal is to understand how people make use of ideophones and iconic affordances to construe meaning, which I study from a usage-based perspective through quantitative corpus analysis and experimental studies. My current GRF project, undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at HKU and Radboud University, focuses on the learnability of ideophones from a cross-linguistic perspective.\nMy PhD dissertation (2020) investigates the Chinese ideophonic lexicon through four different methodological lenses: multiple correspondence analysis, diachronic prototype semantics, semantic vector spaces, and collostructional analysis. A prototypical structuring of the ideophonic lexicon is found throughout the data, which were collected from corpora and the Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD), a freely accessible online database I constructed.\nMy research and teaching approaches focus heavily on turning data into meaningful models and visualizations, that highlight different perspectives inherent in the raw data. For this reason, I invest heavily in teaching students and peers how to wrangle data in the right shape with the programming language R, in order to communicate effectively what the data tell us."

    "text": "My overarching research goal is to understand how people make use of ideophones and iconic affordances to construe meaning, which I study from a usage-based perspective through quantitative corpus analysis and experimental studies. My current GRF project, undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at HKU and Radboud University, focuses on the learnability of ideophones from a cross-linguistic perspective.\nMy PhD dissertation (2020) investigates the Chinese ideophonic lexicon through four different methodological lenses: multiple correspondence analysis, diachronic prototype semantics, semantic vector spaces, and collostructional analysis. A prototypical structuring of the ideophonic lexicon is found throughout the data, which were collected from corpora and the Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD), a freely accessible online database I constructed.\nMy research and teaching approaches focus heavily on turning data into meaningful models and visualizations, that highlight different perspectives inherent in the raw data. For this reason, I invest heavily in teaching students and peers how to wrangle data in the right shape with the programming language R, in order to communicate effectively what the data tell us."

    "text": "New site\nHello beautiful readers.\nIt’s been a while since I updated this blog. But I figured that now’s as good as any to do so. After all, I just transferred the back-end of my website from blogdown to quarto websites. How do you like the new look? For me it looks fresher and maybe more mature, if that’s an adjective you can use to describe a website.\nMore excitingly, today is also the day my new postdoctoral project begins. And while I could try to keep up with the previous updates that happened in my academic life, I think I’ll just see this as a new beginning. But that doesn’t mean I won’t be giving updates on exciting papers that are in the pipeline. Rather, if I’m being really honest here, the venn diagram with the readership of my blog and people that I engage with on a (semi-)regular basis is basically a circle.\n\n\n\n\nWho dis\nSo in a twist of logic, I probably don’t need to do an update, because most will have seen the wonderful places I’ve been able to go to in my time working on the complexity project with Benedikt Szmrecsanyi. For example, with the gracious support from Benedikt, I was able to travel to Oxford for the project start-up with Matt H. Gardner, to South Africa, Australia, Germany, Greece, Leuven (🫰), and soon the center of the world, aka Antwerp (🫰).\n\n\nFormally, the time has come and gone that I was hired on that project. Of course, I am still involved and will remain to be so as long as I’m here. I feel I have finally gotten a grip on the issues within the variationist literature that we are talking about, and working with the SWITCHBOARD spoken corpus data definitely has helped with that. Besides, working with Benedikt is truly a pleasure. That is why we also have a shared PhD student, Ruiming Ma, who is looking at similar things as I was but in Chinese data, which is really exciting. You can read more about that project here.\nLast February, I was also happy to receive my previous supervisor from HKU, Youngah Do, here in Leuven. It was a great opportunity to wrap up some projects we still had in the pipeline, but you know, after some reviewer time had passed. Academic schedules and scholarly time move at a different pace than most people realize.\n\n\nIn general, I have landed in a remarkably good research environment. Without exaggeration, it is hard to find days in which just a quick conversation with someone from the linguistics department, and in particular the people from the QLVL or FunC research groups, say something that makes you go: oh, huh, interesting, lemme think about it. Sometimes this concerns particular methods, or ways of looking at the data; other times, it’s just a topic or a turn in the conversation that will linger on. And bonus points for them for putting up with my stupid jokes at lunch time. It is appreciated.\nAs a group, we work well. I wouldn’t say it’s a hive mind culture, but more a concerned individuals focus group that discusses all sorts of issues. And we’ve also done some team building. For instance, here is the group pic of our QLVL teambuilding last summer.\n\n\n\n\nNew project\nNow, one of the reasons why it has been a minute since I updated my blog is that I’ve busy. Even though I got all the support I needed, after about half a year I realized that couldn’t just rest on my laurels and diminish, go into the West and remain Galadriel. No, if I wanted all to love me and despair, to make this Galadriel metaphor even more convoluted, I would need to start applying to grants, professorships or postdoc fellowships.\n\n\nWhile I originally had the idea to apply for an ERC Starting Grant, I was too late last year and my idea wasn’t full-fledged yet either. But luckily I was able to channel it into an application for the Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship of the Research Foundation of Flanders, our national funding agency. Luckily, I didn’t have to sell my soul to Lucifer and could put off a Faustian deal, but just to be sure I went to this statue in Liège on the day of the defense. #hustleculture\n\n\nI’m grateful that Benedikt agreed to act as the supervisor the project. And I’ve also gotten my previous MA in Linguistics’ supervisor Jean-Christophe Verstraete on board. They are both a great match because the former specialized in variationist linguistics, and the latter in typology. And my project is situated at the crossroads between these two.\nThe full title of the project is “Borrowing iconic words: Loss, transfer, and reinvention of depiction”. To give you an idea of the written pitch, here are the first paragraph of my project.\n\nThe past two decades have shown that iconicity is a fundamental aspect of language. Words are iconic when their forms reveal something about their meanings. For example, woof sounds like the ‘sound of a dog barking’, and zigzag reveals something about ‘running while alternating from side to side’. Iconic words can be found in any natural language. Non-iconic words (prosaic words) can also display iconicity, such as size sound symbolism (/a/ is big, /i/ is small). This is especially true for core vocabulary, i.e., words that resist borrowing into other language families. Hence, there is the hypothesis that iconicity is negatively correlated with borrowability. Surprisingly, this hypothesis has not been tested on iconic words, making it hard to estimate the limits of the relationship between iconicity and borrowing.\n\nNow, you can see that there is the impetus: there is this idea that is floating around. Clearly, I don’t entirely agree with it, for reasons my future papers will make clear. In any case, my proposed solution to this problem is to study the relationship between borrowability and iconicity starting from iconic words rather than from prosaic words that were (synchronically) rated in iconicity.\nI’m very excited to start on this project. The first task consists of the creation of a typological database with lots of iconic lexical material, think onomatopoeia (meow, woof, bang!) and ideophones (zigzag, Jap. pikapika ‘flashing’). The want for such a database is not entirely new. Back in the covid times of 2020-2021, a few of us (Bonnie McLean, Ian Joo, Arthur Thompson, Mark Dingemanse, Jiyeon Park) had the idea to create some sort of “IdeoNet”. But we didn’t really have the funding or the space in our careers to do so. Having advanced a bit further in the career trajectory, I am happy we do have the funding and dedicated man-hour task (i.e., me and my project) to work on this. It is also rebranded as “Depicticon”. So keep an eye out and if you have data to share, please do so.\n\n\nThe rest of the project remains for a future update, shrouded in the mist that has been descending on an autumnal seasoned Leuven. Time to go watch some colored leaves fall down. Adieu."
